    <lyrics>[V1]
 Face to face with Christ my Savior,
 Face to face, what will it be,
 When with rapture I behold Him,
 Jesus Christ, who died for me?
 
[C]
 Face to face shall I behold Him,
 Far beyond the starry sky;
 Face to face in all His glory
 I shall see Him by and by!
 
[V2]
 Only faintly now I see Him,
 With the darkening veil between,
 But a blessed day is coming,
 When His glory shall be seen.
 
[V3]
 What rejoicing in His presence,
 When are banished grief and pain;
 When the crooked ways are straightened,
 And the dark things shall be plain!
 
[V4]
 Face to face! oh, blissful moment!
 Face to face to see and know;
 Face to face with my Redeemer,
 Jesus Christ, who loves me so.</lyrics>
