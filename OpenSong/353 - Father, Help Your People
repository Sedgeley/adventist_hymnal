    <lyrics>[V1]
 Father, help Your people in this world to build
 Something of Your kingdom and to do Your will,
 Lead us to discover partnership in love;
 Bless our ways of sharing and our pride remove.
 
[V2]
 Lord of desk and altar, bind our lives in one,
 That in work and worship love may set the tone.
 Give us grace to listen, clarity of speech;
 Make us truly thankful for the gifts of each.
 
[V3]
 Holy is the setting of each room and yard,
 Lecture hall and kitchen, office, shop, and ward.
 Holy is the rhythm of our working hours;
 Hallow then our purpose, energy, and powâ€™rs.
 
[V4]
 Strengthen, Lord, for service hand and heart and brain;
 Help us good relations daily to maintain.
 Let the living presence of the servant Christ
 Heighten our devotion, make our life a feast.</lyrics>
