    <lyrics>[V1]
 For the fruits of His creation, thanks be to God;
 For the gifts to every nation, thanks be to God;
 For the plowing, sowing, reaping,
 Silent growth while men are sleeping,
 Future needs in earth’s safe keeping, thanks be to God!
 
[V2]
 In the just reward of labor, God’s will is done;
 In the hop we give our neighbor, God’s will is done;
 In our worldwide take of caring
 For the hungry and despairing,
 In the harvests men are sharing, God’s will is done.
 
[V3]
 For the harvests of His Spirit, thanks be to God;
 For the good all men inherit, thanks be to God;
 For the wonders that astound us,
 For the truths that still confound us,
 Most of all, that love has found us, thanks be to God!</lyrics>
