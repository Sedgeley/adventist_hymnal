    <lyrics>[V1]
 Safely through another week
 God has brought us on our way;
 Let us now a blessing seek,
 Waiting in His courts today;
 Day of all the week the best,
 Emblem of eternal rest:
 Day of all the week the best,
 Emblem of eternal rest.
 
[V2]
 While we seek supplies of grace,
 Thro’ the dear Redeemer’s name,
 Show Thy reconciling face;
 Take away the sin and shame:
 From our worldly cares set free,
 May we rest this day in Thee:
 From our worldly cares set free,
 May we rest this day in Thee.
 
[V3]
 When the more shall bid us rise,
 May we feel Thy presence near;
 May Thy glory meet our eyes,
 While we in Thy house appear:
 Here afford us, Lord, a taste
 Of our everlasting feast:
 Here afford us, Lord, a taste
 Of our everlasting feast.
 
[V4]
 May the gospel’s joyful sound
 Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
 Make the fruits of grace abound,
 Bring relief to all complaints:
 Thus may all our Sabbaths be,
 Till we we rise to reign with Thee.
 Thus may all our Sabbaths be,
 Till we we rise to reign with Thee.</lyrics>
