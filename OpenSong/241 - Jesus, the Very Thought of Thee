    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, the very thought of thee
 with sweetness fills the breast;
 but sweeter far thy face to see,
 and in thy presence rest.
 
[V2]
 No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
 Nor can the memory find
 A sweeter sound than Jesusâ€™ name,
 The Savior of mankind.
 
[V3]
 O hope of every contrite heart!
 O joy of all the meek,
 to those who fall, how kind thou art!
 How good to those who seek!
 
[V4]
 But what to those who find? Ah, this
 nor tongue nor pen can show;
 the love of Jesus, what it is,
 none but his loved ones know.
 
[V5]
 Jesus, our only joy be thou,
 as thou our prize wilt be;
 Jesus, be thou our glory now,
 and through eternity.</lyrics>
