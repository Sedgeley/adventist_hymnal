    <lyrics>[V1]
 It came upon the midnight clear,
 That glorious song of old,
 From angels bending near the earth,
 To touch their harps of gold:
 “Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
 From heavens all gracious King!”
 The world in solemn stillness lay
 To hear the angels sing.
 
[V2]
 Still through the cloven skies they come,
 With peaceful wings unfurled;
 And still their heavenly music floats
 O’er all the weary world:
 Above its sad and lowly plains
 They bend on hovering wing,
 And ever o’er its Babel sounds
 The blessed angels sing.
 
[V3]
 O ye beneath life’s crushing load,
 Whose forms are bending low,
 Who toil along the climbing way
 With painful steps and slow;
 Look now, for glad and golden hours
 Come swiftly on the wing;
 Oh rest beside the weary road
 And hear the angels sing.</lyrics>
