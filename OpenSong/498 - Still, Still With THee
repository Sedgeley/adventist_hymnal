    <lyrics>[V1]
 Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,
 When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;
 Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,
 Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.
 
[V2]
 Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,
 The solemn hush of nature newly born;
 Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,
 In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.
 
[V3]
 Still, still with Thee! As to each newborn morning
 A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,
 So does this blessed consciousness, awaking,
 Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.
 
[V4]
 So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,
 When the soul waketh and lifeâ€™s shadows flee;
 O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,
 Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee.</lyrics>
