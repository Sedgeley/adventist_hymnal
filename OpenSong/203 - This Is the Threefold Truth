    <lyrics>[V1]
 This is the threefold truth
 On which our faith depends;
 And with this joyful cry
 Worship begins and ends;
 
[C]
 Christ has died!
 Christ is risen!
 Christ will come again!
 
[V2]
 By this we are upheld
 When doubt and grief assails
 Our Christian fortitude,
 And only grace avails.
 
[C]
 Christ has died!
 Christ is risen!
 Christ will come again!
 
[V3]
 This is the threefold truth
 Which, if we hold it fast,
 Changes the world and us
 And brings us home at last.
 
[C]
 Christ has died!
 Christ is risen!
 Christ will come again!</lyrics>
