    <lyrics>[V1]
 Give to the winds your fears;
 In hope be undismayed:
 God hears your sighs and coundts your tears,
 God shall lift up your head.
 
[V2]
 To Him commit your griefs;
 Your ways put in His hands
 To His sure truth adn tender care
 Who earth adn heave commands.
 
[V3]
 O put your trust in God;
 In dutyâ€™s path go on.
 Walk in His strength with faith and hope,
 So shall your work be done.
 
[V4]
 Leave to His sovereign sway
 To choose and to command;
 So you shall, faithful, seek His way
 how wise, how strong His hand!</lyrics>
