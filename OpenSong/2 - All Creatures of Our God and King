    <lyrics>[V1]
 All creatures of our God and King
 Lift up your voice and with us sing,
 Alleluia! Alleluia!
 O burning sun with golden beam
 And silver moon with softer gleam!
 
[C]
 O praise Him! O praise Him!
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
 
[V2]
 O rushing wind and breezes soft,
 O clouds that ride the winds aloft,
 O praise Him! Alleluia!
 O rising morn, in praise rejoice,
 O lights of evening, find a voice!
 
[V3]
 O flowing waters, pure and clear,
 Make music for your Lord to hear,
 O praise Him! Alleluia!
 O fire so masterful and bright,
 Providing us with warmth and light.
 
[V4]
 Let all things their Creator bless,
 And worship Him in humbleness,
 O praise Him! Alleluia!
 Oh, praise the Father, praise the Son,
 And praise the Spirit, three in One!</lyrics>
