    <lyrics>[V1]
 In the bleak midwinter
 Frosty wind made moan;
 Earth stood hard as iron,
 Water like a stone;
 Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
 Snow on snow,
 In the bleak midwinter,
 Long ago.
 
[V2]
 Angels and archangels
 May have gathered there,
 Cherubim and seraphim
 Thronged the air:
 But His mother only
 In her maiden bliss,
 Worshipped the beloved
 With a kiss.
 
[V3]
 What can I give Him,
 Poor as I am?
 If I were a shepherd
 I would bring a lamb;
 If I were a wise man
 I would do my part;
 Yet what can I give Him?
 Give my heart.</lyrics>
