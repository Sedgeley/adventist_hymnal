    <lyrics>[V1]
 The head that once was crowned with thorns
 Is crowned with glory now;
 A royal diadem adorns
 The mighty victor’s brow.
 
[V2]
 The highest place that heaven affords
 Is His, is His by right;
 The King of kings, and Lord of lords,
 And heaven’s eternal light.
 
[V3]
 The joy of all who dwell above,
 The joy of all below,
 To whom He manifests His love,
 And grants His name to know.
 
[V4]
 To them the cross, with all its shame,
 With all its grace is given;
 Their name an everlasting name,
 Their joy the joy of heaven.
 
[V5]
 To them the cross, with all its shame,
 With all its grace is given;
 Their name an everlasting name,
 Their joy the joy of heaven.</lyrics>
