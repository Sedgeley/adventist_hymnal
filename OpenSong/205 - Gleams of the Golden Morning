    <lyrics>[V1]
 The golden morning is fast approaching;
 Jesus soon will come
 To take his faithful and happy children
 to their promised home
 
[C]
 O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
 piercing thro’ this night of gloom!
 O, see the gleams of the golden morning
 that will burst the tomb.
 
[V2]
 The gospel summons will soon be carried
 to the nations round;
 The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry
 and the trumpet sound.
 
[V3]
 Attended by all the shining angels,
 Down the flaming sky
 the Judge will come, and will take his people
 where they will not die.
 
[V4]
 The lov’d of earth who have long been parted,
 Meet in that glad day;
 The tears of those who are broken hearted
 shall be wiped away.</lyrics>
