    <lyrics>[V1]
 Am I a soldier of the cross,
 a follower of the Lamb,
 and shall I fear to own his cause,
 or blush to speak his name?
 
[V2]
 Must I be carried to the skies
 on flowery beds of ease,
 while others fought to win the prize,
 and sailed through bloody seas?
 
[V3]
 Are there no foes for me to face?
 Must I not stem the flood?
 Is this vile world a friend to grace,
 to help me on to God?
 
[V4]
 Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
 increase my courage, Lord
 Iâ€™ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
 supported by thy word
 
[V5]
 Thy saints in all this glorious war
 shall conquer though they die;
 they see the triumph from afar,
 by faith they bring it nigh
 
[V6]
 When that illustrious day shall rise,
 and all thy armies shine
 in robes of victory through the skies,
 the glory shall be thine</lyrics>
