    <lyrics>[V1]
 He leadeth me: O blessed thought!
 O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
 Whate’er I do, where’er I be,
 still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.
 
[C]
 He leadeth me, he leadeth me,
 by his own hand he leadeth me;
 his faithful follower I would be,
 for by his hand he leadeth me.
 
[V2]
 Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,
 sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,
 by waters still, o’er troubled sea,
 still ’tis his hand that leadeth me.
 
[V3]
 Lord, I would place my hand in thine,
 nor ever murmur nor repine;
 content, whatever lot I see,
 since ’tis my God that leadeth me.
 
[V4]
 And when my task on earth is done,
 when by thy grace the victory’s won,
 e’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
 since God through Jordan leadeth me.</lyrics>
