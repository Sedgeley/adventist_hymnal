    <lyrics>[V1]
 Glorious things of thee are spoken,
 Zion, city of our God;
 He whose word cannot be broken
 Formed thee for His own abode;
 On the Rock of Ages founded,
 What can shake thy sure repose?
 With salvation’s wall surrounded,
 Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.
 
[V2]
 See the streams of living waters
 Springing from eternal love,
 Well supply thy sons and daughters,
 And all fear and want remove;
 Who can faint when such a river
 Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
 Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
 Never fails from age to age.
 
[V3]
 Round each habitation hovering,
 See the cloud and fire appear
 For a glory and a covering,
 Showing that the Lord is near;
 Blest inhabitants of Zion,
 Washed in the Redeemer’s blood;
 Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
 Makes them kings and priests to God.
 
[V4]
 Savior, if of Zion’s city
 I, through grace, a member am,
 Let the world deride or pity,
 I will glory in Thy name;
 Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,
 All his boasted pomp and show;
 Solid joys and lasting treasure
 None but Zion’s children know.</lyrics>
