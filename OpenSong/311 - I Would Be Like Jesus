    <lyrics>[V1]
 Earthly pleasures vainly call me;
 I would be like Jesus;
 Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;
 I would be like Jesus.
 
[C]
 Be like Jesus, this my song,
 In the home and in the throng;
 Be like Jesus, all day long!
 I would be like Jesus.
 
[V2]
 He has broken every fetter,
 I would be like Jesus;
 That my soul may serve Him better,
 I would be like Jesus.
 
[V3]
 All the way from earth to glory,
 I would be like Jesus;
 Telling o’er and o’er the story,
 I would be like Jesus.
 
[V4]
 That in Heaven He may meet me,
 I would be like Jesus;
 That His words “Well done” may greet me,
 I would be like Jesus.</lyrics>
