    <lyrics>[V1]
 I come to the garden alone,
 While the dew is still on the roses;
 And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,
 The Son of God discloses.
 
[C]
 And He walks with me,
 And He talks with me,
 And He tells me I am His own;
 And the joy we share as we tarry there,
 None other has ever known.
 
[V2]
 He speaks, and the sound of His voice
 Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
 And the melody that He gave to me
 Within my heart is ringing.
 
[V3]
 Iâ€™d stay in the garden with Him
 Though the night around me be falling,
 But He bids me go; through the voice of woe,
 His voice to me is calling.</lyrics>
