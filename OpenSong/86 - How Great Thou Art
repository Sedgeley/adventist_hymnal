    <lyrics>[V1]
 O Lord my God
 When I in awesome wonder
 Consider all the worlds
 Thy Hands have made
 I see the stars
 I hear the rolling thunder
 Thy power throughout
 the universe displayed
 
[C]
 Then sings my soul
 My Saviour God to Thee
 How great Thou art
 How great Thou art
 Then sings my soul
 My Saviour God to Thee
 How great Thou art
 How great Thou art
 
[V2]
 When through the woods
 And forest glades I wander
 And hear the birds
 sing sweetly in the trees
 When I look down
 From lofty mountain grandeur
 And see the brook and feel
 the gentle breeze
 
[V3]
 And when I think
 That God His Son not sparing
 Sent Him to die
 I scarce can take it in
 That on the Cross
 My burden gladly bearing
 He bled and died
 to take away my sin.
 
[V4]
 When Christ shall come
 With shouts of acclamation
 And take me home
 What joy shall fill my heart
 Then I shall bow
 In humble adoration
 And then proclaim
 “My God, how great Thou art!”</lyrics>
