    <lyrics>[V1]
 For sunrise hope and sunset calm,
 and all that lies between,
 For all the sweetness and the balm
 that is and that has been,
 For comradeship for peace in strife,
 and light on darkened days;
 For work to do and strength for life
 we sing our hymn of praise.
 
[V2]
 But O, we press far, far above
 these gifts of pure delight,
 And find in Thee, and in Thy love
 contentment infinite.
 O Lord, beloved, in whom are found
 all joys of time and place,
 What will it be when joy is crowned
 by vision of Thy face?</lyrics>
