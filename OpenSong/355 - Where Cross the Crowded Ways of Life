    <lyrics>[V1]
 Where cross the crowded ways of life,
 where sound the cries of race and clan,
 above the noise of selfish strife,
 we hear your voice, O Son of Man.
 
[V2]
 From tender childhood’s helplessness,
 from woman’s grief, man’s burdened toil,
 from famished souls, from sorrow’s stress,
 your heart has never known recoil.
 
[V3]
 The cup of water given for you still
 holds the freshness of your grace;
 yet long these multitudes to view
 the sweet compassion of your face.
 
[V4]
 O Master, from the mountainside
 make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
 among these restless throngs abide;
 O tread the city’s streets again.
 
[V5]
 Till all the world shall learn your love
 and follow where your feet have trod,
 till, glorious from your heaven above,
 shall come the city of our God.</lyrics>
