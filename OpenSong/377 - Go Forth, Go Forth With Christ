    <lyrics>[V1]
 Go forth, go forth with Christ,
 Who called you to this day,
 He who has led, will lead
 And keep you in His way:
 His word is fast, His promise sure
 To all who serve Him and endure.
 
[V2]
 Go forth, go forth with Christ,
 With purpose not your own,
 Each vict’ry you shall gain
 Through Him your Lord alone:
 To guard you in fidelity
 His Spirit shall your strength’ner be.
 
[V3]
 Go forth, go forth with Christ,
 His Priesthood you shall share,
 Who bought us by His blood
 To be His servants here:
 Walk in the way your Savior trod,
 Go forth with Him, go forth with God.</lyrics>
