    <lyrics>[V1]
 Now the joyful bells a-ring,
 All ye mountains of the Lord!
 Lift our hearts like birds a-winging,
 All ye mountains, praise the Lord!
 Now our festal season bringing
 Kinsmen all to bide and board,
 Sets our cheery voices singing;
 All ye mountains, praise the Lord!
 
[V2]
 Dear our home as dear none other;
 Where the mountains praise the Lord!
 Gladly here our care we smother;
 Where the mountains praise the Lord!
 Here we know that Christ our brother
 Binds us all as by a cord:
 He was born of Mary mother
 Where the mountains praise the Lord!
 
[V3]
 Cold the year, new whiteness wearing,
 All ye mountains, praise the Lord!
 Peace, good will to us a-bearing,
 All ye mountains, praise the Lord!
 Now we all Godâ€™s goodness sharing
 Break the bread and sheath the Sword:
 Bright our hearths the signal flaring,
 All ye mountains, praise the Lord!</lyrics>
