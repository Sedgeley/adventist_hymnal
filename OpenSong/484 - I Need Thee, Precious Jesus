    <lyrics>[V1]
 I need Thee precious Jesus, for I am very poor;
 A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.
 I need the love of Jesus to cheer me on my way,
 To guide my doubting foot steps, to be my strength and stay.
 
[V2]
 I need the heart of Jesus to feel each anxious care,
 To tell my every trial, and all my sorrows share.
 I need the Holy Spirit to teach me what I am,
 To show me more of Jesus, to point me to the Lamb.
 
[V3]
 I need Thee precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon,
 Encircled with the rainbow, and seated on Thy throne.
 There with Thy blood-bought children, my joy shall ever be
 To sing Thy ceaseless praises, to gaze, my Lord, on Thee.</lyrics>
