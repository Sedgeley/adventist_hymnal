    <lyrics>[V1]
 I love thy kingdom, Lord,
 the house of thine abode,
 the church our blest Redeemer saved
 with his own precious blood.
 
[V2]
 I love thy church, O God!
 Her walls before thee stand
 dear as the apple of thine eye,
 and graven on thy hand.
 
[V3]
 Beyond my highest joy
 I prize her heavenly ways,
 her sweet communion, solemn vows,
 her hymns of love and praise.
 
[V4]
 Sure as thy truth shall last,
 to Zion shall be given
 the brightest glories earth can yield,
 and brighter bliss of heaven.</lyrics>
