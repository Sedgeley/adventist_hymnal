    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christ is the world’s true light,
 Its captain of salvation,
 The daystar clear and bright
 Of every man and nation;
 New life, new hope awakes
 Where’er men own His sway:
 Freedom her bondage breaks,
 And night is turned to day.
 
[V2]
 In Christ all races meet,
 Their ancient feuds forgetting,
 The whole round world complete,
 From sunrise to its setting:
 When Christ is throned as Lord,
 Men shall forsake their fear,
 To plowshare beat the sword,
 To pruning hook the spear.
 
[V3]
 One Lord, in one great name
 Unite us all who own Thee,
 Cast out our pride and shame
 That hinder to enthrone Thee;
 The world has waited long,
 Has travailed long in pain,
 To heal its ancient wrong,
 Come, Prince of Peace, and reign.</lyrics>
