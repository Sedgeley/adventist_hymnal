    <lyrics>[V1]
 Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
 Thou art the potter, I am the clay.
 Mold me and make me after thy will,
 while I am waiting, yielded and still.
 
[V2]
 Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
 Search me and try me, Savior today!
 Wash me just now, Lord, wash me just now,
 as in thy presence humbly I bow.
 
[V3]
 Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
 Wounded and weary, help me I pray!
 Power, all power, surely is thine!
 Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!
 
[V4]
 Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
 Hold oâ€™er my being absolute sway.
 Fill with thy Spirit till all shall see
 Christ only, always, living in me!</lyrics>
