    <lyrics>[V1]
 The advent of our God
 With eager prayers we greet,
 And singing haste upon His road
 His coming reign to meet.
 
[V2]
 The everlasting Son
 Was born to make us free;
 And He a servantâ€™s form put on
 To gain our liberty.
 
[V3]
 As Judge, on clouds of light,
 He soon will come again,
 His scattered people to unite
 With them in heaven to reign.
 
[V4]
 Praise to the incarnate Son
 Who comes to set us free,
 With Father, Spirit, ever one,
 To all eternity.</lyrics>
