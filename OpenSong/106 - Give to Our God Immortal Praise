    <lyrics>[V1]
 Give to our God immortal praise;
 Mercy and truth are all His ways:
 Wonders of grace to God belong,
 Repeat His mercies in your song.
 
[V2]
 Give to the Lord of lords renown,
 The King of kings with glory crown:
 His mercies ever shall endure
 When lords and kings are known no more.
 
[V3]
 He sent His Son with power to save
 From guilt and darkness and the grave:
 Wonders of grace to God belong,
 Repeat His mercies in your song.
 
[V4]
 Thro’ this vain world He guides our feet,
 And leads us to His heav’nly seat;
 His mercies ever shall endure,
 When this vain world shall be no more.</lyrics>
