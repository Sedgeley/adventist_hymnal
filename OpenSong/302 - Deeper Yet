    <lyrics>[V1]
 In the blood from the cross,
 I have been washed from sin;
 But to be free from dross,
 Still I would enter in.
 
[C]
 Deeper yet, deeper yet,
 Into the crimson flood;
 Deeper yet, deeper yet,
 Under the precious blood.
 
[V2]
 Day by day, hour by hour,
 Blessings are sent to me;
 But for more of His power,
 Ever my prayer shall be.
 
[V3]
 Near to Christ I would live,
 Following Him each day;
 What I ask He will give;
 So then with faith I pray.
 
[V4]
 Now I have peace, sweet peace,
 While in this world of sin;
 But to pray Iâ€™ll not cease
 Till I am pure within.</lyrics>
