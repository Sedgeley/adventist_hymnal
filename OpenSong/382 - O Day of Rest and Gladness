    <lyrics>[V1]
 O day of rest and gladness,
 O day of joy and light,
 O balm of care and sadness,
 most beautiful, most bright;
 on thee, the high and lowly,
 who bend before throne,
 sing, “Holy, holy, holy,”
 to the Eternal One.
 
[V2]
 Thou art a port protected
 from storms that round us rise;
 a garden intersected
 with streams of paradise;
 thou art a cooling fountain
 in life’s dry, dreary sand;
 from thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,
 we view our promised land.
 
[V3]
 A day of sweet reflection,
 thou art a day of love,
 A day to raise affection
 from earth to things above.
 New graces ever gaining
 from this our day of rest,
 We reach the rest remaining
 in mansions of the blessed.</lyrics>
