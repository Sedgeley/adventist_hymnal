    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life:
 such a way as gives us breath,
 such a truth as ends all strife,
 such a life as killeth death.
 
[V2]
 Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength:
 such a light as shows a feast,
 such a feast as mends in length,
 such a strength as makes his guest.
 
[V3]
 Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart:
 such a joy as none can move,
 such a love as none can part,
 such a heart as joys in love.</lyrics>
