    <lyrics>[V1]
 The great Physician now is near,
 The sympathizing Jesus;
 He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
 Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.
 
[C]
 Sweetest note in seraph song,
 Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
 Sweetest carol ever sung,
 Jesus, blessed Jesus.
 
[V2]
 Your many sins are all forgiven,
 Oh! hear the voice of Jesus;
 Go on your way in peace to heaven,
 And wear a crown with Jesus.
 
[V3]
 All glory to the dying Lamb!
 I now believe in Jesus;
 I love the blessed Saviorâ€™s name,
 I love the name of Jesus.
 
[V4]
 His name dispels my guilt and fear,
 No other name but Jesus;
 Oh! how my soul delights to hear
 The charming name of Jesus.</lyrics>
