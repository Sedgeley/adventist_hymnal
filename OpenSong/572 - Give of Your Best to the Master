    <lyrics>[V1]
 Give of your best to the master,
 Give of the strength of your youth;
 Throw your soul’s fresh, glowing ardor
 Into the battle for truth.
 Jesus has set the example –
 Dauntless was He, young and brave;
 Give Him your loyal devotion,
 Give Him the best that you have.
 
[C]
 Give of your best to the master,
 Give of the strength of your youth;
 Clad in salvation’s full armor,
 Join in the battle for truth.
 
[V2]
 Give of your best to the Master,
 Give Him first place in your heart;
 Give Him first place in your service,
 Consecrate every part.
 Give, and to you shall be given –
 God His beloved Son gave;
 Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
 Give Him the best that you have.
 
[V3]
 Give of your best to the Master,
 Naught else is worthy His love;
 He gave Himself for your ransom,
 Have up His glory above;
 Laid down His life without murmur,
 You from sin’s ruin to save;
 Give Him your heart’s adoration,
 Give Him the best that you have.</lyrics>
