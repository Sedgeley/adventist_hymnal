    <lyrics>[V1]
 Let us with a gladsome mind
 Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
 
[V2]
 He, with all commanding might,
 Filled the new made world with light:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
 
[V3]
 All things living He does feed;
 His full hand supplies their need:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
 
[V4]
 Let us then with gladsome mind
 Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
 For His mercies shall endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure.</lyrics>
