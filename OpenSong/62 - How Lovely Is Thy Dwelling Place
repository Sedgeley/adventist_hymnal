    <lyrics>[V1]
 How lovely is Thy dwelling place,
 O Lord of hosts to me!
 The tabenacles of Thy grace
 How pleasant, Lord, they be!
 
[V2]
 My thirsty soul longs ardently,
 Yea, faints Thy courts to see;
 My very heart and flesh cry out,
 O living God, for Thee.
 
[V3]
 Behold the sparrow findeth out
 A house where-in to rest;
 The swallow also, for herself
 Provided hath a nest.
 
[V4]
 Evâ€™n Thine own altars, where she safe
 Her young ones forth may bring,
 O Thou, almighty Lord of hosts,
 Who art my God and King.
 
[V5]
 Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,
 They ever give Thee praise.
 Blest is the man whose strength Thou art,
 In whose heart are Thy ways.</lyrics>
