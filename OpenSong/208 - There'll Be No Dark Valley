    <lyrics>[V1]
 There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
 There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
 There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
 To gather His loved ones home.
 
[C]
 To gather His loved ones home,
 To gather His loved ones home.
 There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
 To gather His loved ones home.
 
[V2]
 There’ll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
 There’ll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
 There’ll be a happy tomorrow when Jesus comes,
 To gather His loved ones home.
 
[V3]
 There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
 There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
 There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
 To gather His loved ones home.</lyrics>
