    <lyrics>[V1]
 There is a place of quiet rest,
 near to the heart of God;
 a place where sin cannot molest,
 near to the heart of God.
 
[C]
 O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
 sent from the heart of God,
 hold us who wait before thee
 near to the heart of God.
 
[V2]
 There is a place of comfort sweet,
 near to the heart of God;
 a place where we our Savior meet,
 near to the heart of God.
 
[V3]
 There is place a place of full release,
 near to the heart of God;
 a place where all is joy and peace,
 near to the heart of God.</lyrics>
