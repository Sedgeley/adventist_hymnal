    <lyrics>[V1]
 While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
 All seated on the ground,
 The angel of the Lord came down,
 And glory shone around.
 
[V2]
 “Fear nor!” said he- for mighty dread
 Had seized their troubled mind-
 “Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
 To you and all mankind.
 
[V3]
 “To you, in David’s town this day,
 Is born of David’s line,
 The Savior who is Christ the Lord;
 And this shall be the sign:
 
[V4]
 “The heavenly Babe you there shall find
 To human view displayed,
 All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
 And in a manger laid.”
 
[V5]
 Thus spake the seraph; and forth with
 Appeared a shining throng
 Of angels praising God on high,
 Who thus addressed their song:
 
[V6]
 “All glory be to God on high,
 And to the earth be peace;
 Good will henceforth from heaven to men,
 Begin and never cease!”</lyrics>
