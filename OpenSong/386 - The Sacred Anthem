    <lyrics>[V1]
 The sacred anthem slowly rang
 Across the fields of praise,
 When earth’s first Sabbath made complete
 All creatures and all days.
 
[V2]
 Walking with God, there,
 Woman and man together share
 The blessed Sabbath mood;
 And in that green and golden world
 Know all God’s works are good.
 
[V3]
 But now in our diminished lives
 We sing a blemished song;
 The earth is worn and disarrayed
 And all our work goes wrong.
 
[V4]
 Still in our worship,
 Joining in praise and fellowship,
 By Sabbath radiance blessed,
 We put our doubt and fear away
 And rest within God’s rest.
 
[V5]
 And arching over time and space
 The Lord of Sabbaths wills
 Renewal for the weary earth
 And healing for our ills.
 
[V6]
 Hearts will rejoice then;
 There will be no more weeping, when
 We know and shall be known.
 With hosts of the redeemed we’ll sing
 Around God’s shining throne.</lyrics>
