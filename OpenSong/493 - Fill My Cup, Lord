    <lyrics>[V1]
 Like the woman at the well I was seeking
 For things that could not satisfy:
 And then I heard my Savior speaking:
 ” Draw from my well that never shall run dry”.
 
[C]
 Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
 Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
 Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more–
 Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
 
[V2]
 There are millions in this world who are craving
 The pleasures earthly things afford;
 But none can match the wondrous treasure
 That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.
 
[V3]
 So, my brother, if the things this world gave you
 Leave hungers that won’t pass away,
 My blessed Lord will come and save you,
 If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:</lyrics>
