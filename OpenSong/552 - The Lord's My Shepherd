    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want.
 He makes me down to lie
 In pastures green; He leadeth me
 The quiet waters by.
 
[V2]
 My soul He doth restore again.
 And me to walk doth make
 Within the paths of righteousness,
 E’en for His own name’s sake.
 
[V3]
 Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale,
 Yet will I fear no ill,
 For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
 And staff me comfort still.
 
[V4]
 My table Thou hast furnished
 In presence of my foes;
 My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
 And my cup overflows.
 
[V5]
 Goodness and mercy all my life
 Shall surely follow me;
 And in God’s house forevermore
 My dwelling place shall be.</lyrics>
