    <lyrics>[V1]
 O soul, are you weary and troubled?
 No light in the darkness you see?
 There’s light for a look at the Savior,
 And life more abundant and free!
 
[C]
 Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
 Look full in His wonderful face,
 And the things of earth
 will grow strangely dim,
 In the light
 of His glory and grace.
 
[V2]
 Through death into life everlasting
 He passed, and we follow Him there;
 Over us sin no more hath dominion—
 For more than conquerors we are!
 
[V3]
 His Word shall not fail you He promised;
 Believe Him, and all will be well:
 Then go to a world that is dying,
 His perfect salvation to tell!</lyrics>
