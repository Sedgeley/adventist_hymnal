    <lyrics>[V1]
 You will see your Lord a-coming,
 You will see your Lord a-coming,
 You will see your Lord a-coming
 In a few more days.
 
[C]
 Hear the band of music,
 Hear the band of music,
 Hear the band of music
 which is sounding thro’ the air.
 
[V2]
 Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
 Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
 Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet
 In a few more days.
 
[V3]
 You will see the saints arising,
 You will see the saints arising,
 You will see the saints arising
 In a few more days.
 
[V4]
 Angels bear them to the Savior,
 Angels bear them to the Savior,
 Angels bear them to the Savior
 In a few more days.
 
[V5]
 Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
 Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
 Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over
 In a few more days.</lyrics>
