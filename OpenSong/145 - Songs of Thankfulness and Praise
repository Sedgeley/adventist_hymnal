    <lyrics>[V1]
 Songs of thankfulness and praise,
 Jesus, Lord, to You we raise,
 Manifested by the star
 To the sages from afar;
 Branch of royal David’s stem
 In Your birth at Bethlehem;
 Anthems be to You addressed,
 God in man made manifest.
 
[V2]
 Manifest at Jordan’s stream,
 Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;
 And at Cana, wedding guest,
 In Your Godhead manifest;
 Manifest in power divine,
 Changing water into wine;
 Anthems be to You addressed,
 God in man made manifest.
 
[V3]
 Manifest in making whole
 Palsied limbs and fainting soul;
 Manifest in valiant fight,
 Quelling all the devil’s might;
 Manifest in gracious will,
 Ever bringing good from ill;
 Anthems be to You addressed,
 God in man made manifest.
 
[V4]
 Grant us grace to see You, Lord,
 Mirrored in Your holy Word;
 May we imitate Your way,
 And be pure, as pure as we may,
 That we like You may be
 At Your great epiphany;
 Let us praise You, ever blest,
 God in man made manifest.</lyrics>
