    <lyrics>[V1]
 The wonders of redeeming love
 Our highest thoughts exceed;
 The Son of God comes from above
 For sinful man to bleed.
 
[V2]
 He gives Himself, His life, His all,
 A sinless sacrifice.
 For man He drains the cup of gall,
 For man the victim dies.
 
[V3]
 And now before His Fatherâ€™s face
 His precious blood He pleads;
 For those who seek the throne of grace
 His love still intercedes.
 
[V4]
 He knows the frailties of our frame,
 For He has borne our grief;
 Our great High Priest once felt the same,
 And He can send relief.
 
[V5]
 His love will not be satisfied,
 Till He in glory sees
 The faithful ones for whom He died
 From sin forever free.
