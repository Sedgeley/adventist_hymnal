    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, thou long expected Jesus!
 born to set thy people free;
 from our fears and sins release us,
 let us find our rest in thee.
 Israelâ€™s strength and consolation,
 hope of all the earth thou art;
 dear desire of every nation,
 joy of every longing heart.
 
[V2]
 Born thy people to deliver,
 born a child and yet a King,
 born to reign in us forever,
 now thy gracious kingdom bring.
 By thine own eternal spirit
 rule in all our hearts alone;
 by thine all sufficient merit,
 raise us to thy glorious throne.</lyrics>
