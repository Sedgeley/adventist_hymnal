    <lyrics>[V1]
 When all my labors and trails are oâ€™er,
 And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
 Just to be near the Lord I adore,
 Will through the ages be glory for me.
 
[C]
 O that will be
 O      that will
 Glory for me, Glory for me,
 Be    glory for me,    Glory for me,
 Glory for me; When by His grace
 Glory for me;
 I shall look on His face,
 That will be glory, be glory for me.
 
[V2]
 When, by the gift of His infinite grace,
 I am accorded in heaven a place,
 Just to be there and to look on His face,
 Will through the ages be glory for me.
 
[V3]
 Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
 Joy like a river around me will flow,
 Yet, just a smile form my Savior, I know,
 Will through the ages be glory for me.</lyrics>
