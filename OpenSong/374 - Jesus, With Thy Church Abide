    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, with Thy church abide;
 Be her Savior, Lord, and Guide,
 While on earth her faith is tried:
 We beseech Thee, hear us.
 
[V2]
 May her voice be ever clear,
 Warning of a judgment near,
 Telling of a Savior dear:
 We beseech Thee, hear us.
 
[V3]
 May she guide the poor and blind,
 Seek the lost until she find,
 And the broken hearted bind:
 We beseech Thee, hear us.
 
[V4]
 May she holy triumps win,
 Overthrow the hosts of sin,
 Gather all the nations in:
 We beseech Thee, hear us.</lyrics>
