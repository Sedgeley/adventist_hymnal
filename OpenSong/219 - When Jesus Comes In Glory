    <lyrics>[V1]
 When Jesus comes in glory,
 As Lord and King of kings,
 O what a wondrous story
 The blessed Bible brings:
 His face will shine like the sunlight,
 His head be white as snow,
 His eyes like flaming firelight,
 His feet like brass aglow.
 
[V2]
 His voice like rushing waters
 Will reach with mighty sound
 Into the deepest quarters
 Of all creation round;
 And at this wondrous greeting
 The dead in Christ shall rise,
 Their Lord and Saviour meeting
 In glory in the skies.
 
[V3]
 And we who believing
 And His appearing love,
 Shall know we are receiving
 His glory from above;
 His resurrection power
 Will raise us to the place
 Where we that wondrous hour
 Shall see Him face to face.
 
[V4]
 O hasten Thine appearing
 Thou bright and Morning Star!
 Lord, may we soon be hearing
 The trumpet sound afar;
 They people all are yearning
 To be Thy raptured bride,
 To be Thy own returning
 Be caught up to Thy side.</lyrics>
