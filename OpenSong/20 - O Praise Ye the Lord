    <lyrics>[V1]
 O praise ye the Lord!
 Praise Him in the height;
 Rejoice in His word,
 Ye angels of light;
 Ye heavens, adore Him
 By whom ye were made,
 And worship before Him,
 In brightness arrayed.
 
[V2]
 O praise ye the Lord!
 Praise Him upon earth,
 In tuneful accord:
 Ye sons of new birth;
 Praise Him who hath brought
 you His grace from above,
 Praise Him who hath taught you
 To sing of His love.
 
[V3]
 O praise ye the Lord,
 All things that give sound;
 Each jubilant chord,
 Re-echo around;
 Loud organs His glory
 Forth tell in deep tone,
 And sweet harp, the story
 Of what He hath done.
 
[V4]
 O praise ye the Lord!
 Thanksgiving and song
 To Him be outpoured
 All ages along:
 For love in creation,
 For heaven restored.
 For grace of salvation,
 O praise ye the Lord!</lyrics>
