    <lyrics>[V1]
 Eternal Father, strong to save,
 Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
 Who bidd’st the mighty ocean deep
 Its own appointed limits keep;
 O hear us when we cry to Thee
 For those in peril on the sea.
 
[V2]
 O Saviour, whose almighty word
 The winds and waves submissive heard,
 Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
 And calm amid its rage didst sleep;
 O hear us when we cry to Thee
 For those in peril on the sea.
 
[V3]
 O Sacred Spirit, who didst brood
 Upon the chaos dark and rude,
 Who badd’st its angry tumult cease,
 And gavest light and life and peace;
 O hear us when we cry to Thee
 For those in peril on the sea.
 
[V4]
 O Trinity of love and power,
 Our brethren shield in danger’s hour;
 From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
 Protect them wheresoe’er they go;
 And ever let there rise to Thee
 Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.</lyrics>
