    <lyrics>[V1]
 Would you be free
 from the burden of sin?
 There’s pow’r in the blood,
 pow’r in the blood;
 Would you o’er evil
 a victory win?
 There’s wonderful
 power in the blood.
 
[C]
 There is pow’r, pow’r,
 wonder working pow’r
 In the blood of the Lamb;
 There is pow’r, pow’r,
 wonder working pow’r
 In the precious blood of the Lamb.
 
[V2]
 Would be free
 from your passion and pride?
 There’s pow’r in the blood,
 pow’r in the blood;
 Come for a cleansing
 to Calvary’s tide?
 There’s wonderful
 power in the blood.
 
[V3]
 Would you do service
 for Jesus your King?
 There’s pow’r in the blood,
 pow’r in the blood;
 Would you live daily
 His praises to sing?
 There’s wonderful
 power in the blood.</lyrics>
