    <lyrics>[V1]
 My faith has found a resting place,
 Not in a manmade creed;
 I trust the ever living One,
 That He for me shall plead.
 
[C]
 I need no other evidence,
 I need no other plea;
 It is enough that Jesus died,
 And rose again for me.
 
[V2]
 Enough for me that Jesus saves,
 This ends my fear and doubt;
 A sinful soul, I come to Him,
 He will not cast me out.
 
[V3]
 My soul is resting on the Word,
 The living Word of God,
 Salvation in my Saviorâ€™s name,
 Salvation through His blood.
 
[V4]
 My great Physician heals the sick,
 The lost He came to save;
 For me His precious blood He shed,
 For me His life He gave.</lyrics>
