    <lyrics>[V1]
 Out of my bondage, sorrow and night,
 Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
 Into Thy freedom, gladness and light,
 Jesus, I come to Thee;
 Out of my sickness into Thy health,
 Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
 Out of my sin and into Thyself,
 Jesus, I come to Thee.
 
[V2]
 Out of my shameful failure and loss,
 Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
 Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,
 Jesus, I come to Thee;
 Out of earth’s sorrows into Thy balm,
 Out of life’s storms and into Thy calm,
 Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
 Jesus, I come to Thee.
 
[V3]
 Out of unrest and arrogant pride,
 Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
 Into Thy blessed will to abide,
 Jesus, I come to Thee;
 Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,
 Out of despair into raptures above,
 Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
 Jesus, I come to Thee.
 
[V4]
 Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
 Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
 Into the joy and light of Thy home,
 Jesus, I come to Thee;
 Out of the depths of ruin untold,
 Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
 Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
 Jesus, I come to Thee.</lyrics>
