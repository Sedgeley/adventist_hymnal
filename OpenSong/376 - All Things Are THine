    <lyrics>[V1]
 All things are Thine; no gift have we,
 Lord of all gifts, to offer Thee;
 And hence with grateful hearts today,
 Thine own before Thy feet we lay.
 
[V2]
 Thy will was in the builder’s thought;
 Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
 Thro’ mortal motive, scheme and plan,
 Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.
 
[V3]
 No lack Thy perfect fullness knew;
 For human needs and longings grew
 This house of prayer- this home of rest.
 Here may Thy saints be often blessed.
 
[V4]
 In weakness and in want we call
 On Thee, for whom the heav’ns are small;
 Thy glory is Thy children’s good,
 Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.
 
[V5]
 O Father! deign these walls to bless;
 Make this the abode of righteousness,
 And let these doors a gateway be
 To lead us from ourselves to Thee!</lyrics>
