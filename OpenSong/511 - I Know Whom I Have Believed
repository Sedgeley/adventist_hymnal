    <lyrics>[V1]
 I know not why God’s wondrous grace
 To me He hath made known,
 Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
 Redeemed me for His own.
 
[C]
 But “I know whom I have believed,
 and am persuaded that His is able
 To keep that which I’ve committed
 Unto Him against that day.”
 
[V2]
 I know not how this saving faith
 To me He did impart,
 Nor how believing in His word
 Wrought peace within my heart.
 
[V3]
 I know not how the Spirit moves,
 Convincing men of sin,
 Revealing Jesus through the word,
 Creating faith in Him.
 
[V4]
 I know not when my Lord may come,
 At night or noonday fair,
 Nor if I walk the vale with Him,
 Or meet Him in the air.</lyrics>
