    <lyrics>[V1]
 O for a thousand tongues to sing
 my great Redeemer’s praise,
 the glories of my God and King,
 the triumphs of his grace!
 
[V2]
 My gracious Master and my God,
 assist me to proclaim,
 to spread through all the earth abroad
 the honors of thy name.
 
[V3]
 Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
 that bids our sorrows cease;
 ’tis music in the sinner’s ears,
 ’tis life, and health, and peace.
 
[V4]
 He breaks the power of canceled sin,
 he sets the prisoner free;
 his blood can make the foulest clean;
 his blood availed for me.
 
[V5]
 He speaks, and listening to his voice,
 new life the dead receive;
 the mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
 the humble poor believe.
 
[V6]
 Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
 your loosened tongues employ;
 ye blind, behold your savior come,
 and leap, ye lame, for joy.</lyrics>
