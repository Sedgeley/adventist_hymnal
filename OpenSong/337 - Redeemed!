    <lyrics>[V1]
 Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
 Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
 His child and forever I am.
 
[C]
 Redeemed, redeemed,
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
 Redeemed, redeemed,
 His child and forever I am.
 
[V2]
 Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,
 No language my rapture can tell;
 I know that the light of His presence
 With me doth continually dwell.
 
[V3]
 I know thereâ€™s a crown that is waiting
 In yonder bright mansion for me;
 And soon, with the spirit made perfect,
 At home with the Lord I shall be.</lyrics>
