    <lyrics>[V1]
 By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,
 We keep the memory adored,
 And show the death of our dear Lord,
 Until He come.
 
[V2]
 His broken body in our stead is here,
 In his memorial bread;
 And so our feeble love is fed,
 Until He come.
 
[V3]
 His fearful drops of agony,
 His lifeblood shed for us we see;
 The wine shall tell the mystery,
 Until He come.
 
[V4]
 And thus that dark betrayal night,
 With the last advent we unite
 The shame, the glory, by this rite,
 Until He come.</lyrics>
