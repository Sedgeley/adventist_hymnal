    <lyrics>[V1]
 O sing a new song to the Lord
 For marvels He has done;
 His right hand and His holy arm
 The victory have won.
 
[V2]
 With harp, and voice of psalms
 Unto Jehovah sing;
 Let trumpets and the echoing horn
 Acclaim the Lord our King!
 
[V3]
 Let seas with all their creatures roar,
 The world and dwellers there,
 And let the rivers clap their hands,
 The hills their joy declare.
 
[V4]
 Before the Lord: because He comes,
 To judge the earth come He;
 Heâ€™ll judge the world
 with righteousness,
 His folk with equity.</lyrics>
