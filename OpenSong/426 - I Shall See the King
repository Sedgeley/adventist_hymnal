    <lyrics>[V1]
 I shall see the King where the angels sing,
 I shall see the King some day, in the better land,
 On that golden strand,
 And with Him shall ever stay.
 
[C]
 In His glory, I shall see the King,
 And forever endless praises sing;
 â€˜Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
 I shall see the King someday.
 
[V2]
 In the land of song, in the glory throng,
 Where there never comes a night,
 With my Lord once slain I shall ever reign
 In the glory land of light.
 
[V3]
 I shall see the King, all my tributes bring,
 And shall look upon His face;
 Then my song shall be how He ransomed me
 And has kept me by His grace.</lyrics>
