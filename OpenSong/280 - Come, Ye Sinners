    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, ye sinners poor and needy,
 Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
 Jesus ready stands to save you,
 Full of pity, love, and power.
 
[C]
 I will arise and go to Jesus,
 He will embrace me in His arms;
 In the arms of my dear Savior,
 O there are ten thousand charms.
 
[V2]
 Come. ye thirsty, come, and welcome,
 God’s free bounty glorify;
 True belief and true repentance,
 Every grace that brings you nigh.
 
[V3]
 Let not conscience make you linger,
 Nor of fitness fondly dream;
 All the fitness He requireth
 Is to feel your need of Him.
 
[V4]
 Lo! th’incarnate God, ascended,
 Pleads the merit of His blood;
 Venture on Him, venture wholly,
 Let no other trust intrude.</lyrics>
