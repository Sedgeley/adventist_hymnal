    <lyrics>[V1]
 I need the prayers of those I love,
 While trav’ling o’er life’s rugged way,
 That I may true and faithful be,
 And live for Jesus every day.
 
[C]
 I want my friends to pray for me,
 To bear my tempted soul above,
 And intercede with God for me;
 I need the prayers of those I love.
 
[V2]
 I need the prayers of those I love,
 To help me in each trying hour,
 To bear my tempted sould to Him,
 That He may keep me by His pow’r.
 
[C]
 I want my friends to pray for me,
 To hold me up on wing of faith,
 That I may walk the narrow way,
 Kept by our Father’s glorious grace.</lyrics>
