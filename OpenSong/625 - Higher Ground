    <lyrics>[V1]
 I’m pressing on the upward way,
 New heights I’m gaining every day;
 Still praying as I’m onward bound,
 “Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”
 
[C]
 Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
 By faith, on Heaven’s table land,
 A higher plane than I have found;
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
 
[V2]
 My heart has no desire to stay
 Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
 Though some may dwell where those abound,
 My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.
 
[V3]
 I want to live above the world,
 Though Satan’s darts at me are hurled;
 For faith has caught the joyful sound,
 The song of saints on higher ground.
 
[V4]
 I want to scale the utmost height
 And catch a gleam of glory bright;
 But still I’ll pray till Heav’n I’ve found,
 “Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”</lyrics>
