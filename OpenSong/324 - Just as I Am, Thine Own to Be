    <lyrics>[V1]
 Just as I am, Thine own to be,
 Friend of the young, who lovest me,
 To consecrate myself to Thee,
 O Jesus Christ, I come.
 
[V2]
 In the glad morning of my day,
 My life to give, my vows to pay,
 With no reserve and no delay,
 With all my heart I come.
 
[V3]
 I would live ever in the light,
 I would work ever for the right;
 I would serve Thee with all my might;
 Therefore, to Thee I come.
 
[V4]
 Just as I am, young, strong, and free,
 To be the best that I can be
 For truth, and righteousness, and Thee,
 Lord of my life, I come.</lyrics>
