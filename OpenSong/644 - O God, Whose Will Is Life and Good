    <lyrics>[V1]
 O God, whose will is life and good
 For all of mortal breath:
 Unite in bonds of servanthood
 All those who strive with death.
 
[V2]
 Make strong their hands and hearts and wills
 To drive disease afar,
 To strive against the body’s ills
 And wage Your healing war.
 
[V3]
 By healing of the sick and blind,
 Christ’s mercy they proclaim,
 Make known the great physician’s mind,
 Affirm the Savior’s name.
 
[V4]
 Before them set Your gracious will,
 That they, with heart and soul,
 To You may consecrate their skill
 And make the sufferer whole.</lyrics>
