    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord’s our Rock, in Him we hide,
 A shelter in the time of storm;
 Secure whatever ill betide,
 A shelter in the time of storm.
 
[C]
 Mighty Rock in a weary land,
 Cooling shade on the burning sand,
 Faithful guide for the pilgrim band—
 A shelter in the time of storm.
 
[V2]
 A shade by day, defense by night,
 A shelter in the time of storm;
 No fears alarm, no foes afright,
 A shelter in the time of storm.
 
[V3]
 The raging storms may round us beat,
 A shelter in the time of storm
 We’ll never leave our safe retreat,
 A shelter in the time of storm.
 
[V4]
 O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
 A Shelter in the time of storm;
 Be Thou our helper ever near,
 A Shelter in the time of storm.</lyrics>
