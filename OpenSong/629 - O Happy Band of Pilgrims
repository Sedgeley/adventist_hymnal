    <lyrics>[V1]
 O happy band of pilgrims,
 If onward ye will tread
 With Jesus as your fellow,
 To Jesus as your Head!
 
[V2]
 O happy if ye labor
 As Jesus did for men;
 O happy if ye hunger
 As Jesus hungered then!
 
[V3]
 The trials that beset you,
 The sorrows ye endure,
 The manifold temptations
 That death alone can cure,
 
[V4]
 What are they but His jewels
 Of right celestial worth?
 What are they but the ladder
 Set up to heaven on earth?
 
[V5]
 O happy band of pilgrims,
 Look upward to the skies,
 Where such a light affliction
 Shall win you such a prize!</lyrics>
