    <lyrics>[V1]
 wise may bring their learning,
 The rich may bring their wealth,
 And some may bring their greatness,
 And some their strength and health:
 We too would bring our treasures
 To offer to the King,
 We have no wealth or learning—
 What shall we children bring?
 
[V2]
 We’ll bring Him hearts that love Him,
 We’ll bring Him thankful praise,
 And young souls meekly striving
 To follow in His ways:
 And these be the treasures
 We offer to the King,
 And these are gifts that ever
 The poorest child may bring.
 
[V3]
 We’ll bring the little duties
 We have to do each day;
 We’ll try our best to please Him
 At home, at school, at play:
 And better are these treasures
 To offer to the King
 Than richest gift without them:
 Yet these a child may bring.</lyrics>
