    <lyrics>[V1]
 All people that on earth do dwell,
 sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
 Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell;
 come ye before him and rejoice.
 
[V2]
 Know that the Lord is God indeed;
 without our aid he did us make;
 we are his folk, he doth us feed,
 and for his sheep he doth us take.
 
[V3]
 O enter then his gates with praise;
 approach with joy his courts unto;
 praise, laud, and bless his name always,
 for it is seemly so to do.
 
[V4]
 For why! the Lord our God is good;
 his mercy is forever sure;
 his truth at all times firmly stood,
 and shall from age to age endure.</lyrics>
