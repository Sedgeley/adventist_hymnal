    <lyrics>[V1]
 I hear the Savior say,
 “Thy strength indeed is small;
 Child of weakness, watch and pray,
 Find in Me thine all in all.”
 
[C]
 Jesus paid it all,
 All to Him I owe;
 Sin had left a crimson stain,
 He washed it white as snow.
 
[V2]
 Lord, now indeed I find
 Thy power and Thine alone,
 Can change the leper’s spots
 And melt the heart of stone.
 
[V3]
 Since nothing good have I
 Whereby Thy grace to claim,
 I’ll wash my garments white
 In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.
 
[V4]
 And when before the throne
 I stand in Him complete,
 I’ll lay my trophies down
 All down at Jesus’ feet.</lyrics>
