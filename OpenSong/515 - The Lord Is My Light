    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?
 By day and by night His presence is near;
 He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;
 This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.
 
[C]
 The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
 By day and by night He leads me along;
 The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
 By day and by night He leads me along.
 
[V2]
 The Lord is my light; though clods may arise,
 Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies
 Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:
 Then how can I ever in darkness remain?
 
[V3]
 The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;
 I know in His might Iâ€™ll conquer at length;
 My weakness in mercy He covers with power,
 And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.
 
[V4]
 The lord is my light, my all and in all;
 There is in His sight no darkness at all;
 He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;
 With saints and with angels His praises I sing.</lyrics>
