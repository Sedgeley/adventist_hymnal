    <lyrics>[V1]
 In the morning, when I rise
 In the morning, when I rise
 In the morning, when I rise
 
[C]
 Give me Jesus.
 Give me Jesus,
 Give me Jesus.
 You can have all this world,
 Just give me Jesus.
 
[V2]
 Dark mid-night was my cry,
 Dark mid-night was my cry,
 Dark midnight was my cry,
 Give me Jesus.
 
[V3]
 Just about the break of day,
 Just about the break of day,
 Just about the break of day,
 Give me Jesus.
 
[V4]
 Oh, when I come to die,
 Oh, when I come to die,
 Oh, when I come to die,
 Give me Jesus.</lyrics>
