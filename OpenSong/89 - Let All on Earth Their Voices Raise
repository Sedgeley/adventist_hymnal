    <lyrics>[V1]
 Let all on earth their voices raise,
 To sing the great Jehovahâ€™s praise,
 And bless His holy name:
 His glory let the people know,
 His wonders to the nations show,
 His saving grace proclaim.
 
[V2]
 He framed the globe; He built the sky;
 He made the shining worlds on high,
 And reigns in glory there:
 His beams are majesty and light;
 His beauties, how divinely bright!
 His dwelling place, how fair!
 
[V3]
 Come, the great day, the glorious hour,
 When earth shall feel His saving power,
 All nations fear His name;
 Then shall the race of men confess
 The beauty of His holiness,
 His saving grace proclaim.</lyrics>
