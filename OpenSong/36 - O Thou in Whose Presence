    <lyrics>[V1]
 O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
 On whom in affliction I call,
 My comfort by day and my song in the night,
 My hope, my salvation, my all!
 
[V2]
 His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,
 Is heard through the shadows of death;
 The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,
 The air is perfumed with His breath.
 
[V3]
 His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,
 To water the gardens of grace;
 From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
 And bask in the smiles of His face.
 
[V4]
 He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
 And myriads wait for His word;
 He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,
 Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.</lyrics>
