    <lyrics>[V1]
 I am thine, O Lord,
 I have heard thy voice,
 and it told thy love to me;
 but I long to rise
 in the arms of faith
 and be closer drawn to thee.
 
[C]
 Draw me nearer,
 nearer, blessed Lord,
 to the cross where thou hast died.
 Draw me nearer, nearer,
 nearer, blessed Lord,
 to thy precious, bleeding side.
 
[V2]
 Consecrate me now
 to thy service, Lord,
 by the power of grace divine;
 let my soul look up
 with a steadfast hope,
 and my will be lost in thine.
 
[V3]
 O the pure delight
 of a single hour
 that before thy throne I spend,
 when I kneel in prayer,
 and with thee, my God,
 I commune as friend with friend!</lyrics>
