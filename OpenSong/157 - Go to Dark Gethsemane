    <lyrics>[V1]
 Go to dark Gethsemane,
 Ye who feel the tempter’s power
 Your Redeemer’s conflict see.
 Watch with him one bitter hour;
 Turn not from his griefs away;
 Learn from Jesus Christ to pray.
 
[V2]
 See Him at the judgment hall,
 Beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;
 See Him meekly bearing all;
 Love to man His soul sustained!
 Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
 Learn from him to bear the cross.
 
[V3]
 Calvary’s mournful mountain climb;
 There, adoring at his feet,
 Mark that miracle of time,
 God’s own sacrifice complete.
 “It is finished!” hear him cry;
 Learn from Jesus Christ to die.</lyrics>
