    <lyrics>[V1]
 The church has waited long
 Her absent Lord to see;
 And still in loneliness she waits,
 A friendless stranger she.
 
[V2]
 How long, O Lord our God,
 Holy and true and good,
 Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,
 Her sighs and tears and blood?
 
[V3]
 We long to hear Thy voice,
 To see Thee face to face,
 To share Thy crown and glory then,
 As now we share Thy grace.
 
[V4]
 Come, Lord, and wipe away
 The curse, the sin, the stain,
 And make this blighted world of ours
 Thine own fair world again.</lyrics>
