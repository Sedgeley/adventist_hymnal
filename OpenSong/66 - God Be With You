    <lyrics>[V1]
 God be with you till we meet again;
 By His counsels guide, uphold you,
 With His sheep securely fold you:
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
[V2]
 God be with you till we meet again;
 Neath His wings securely hide you,
 Daily manna still provide you:
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
[V3]
 God be with you till we meet again;
 When life’s perils thick confound you,
 Put His arms unfailing round you:
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
[V4]
 God be with you till we meet again;
 Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,
 Smite death’s threatening wave before you:
 God be with you till we meet again.</lyrics>
