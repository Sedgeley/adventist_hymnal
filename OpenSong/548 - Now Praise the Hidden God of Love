    <lyrics>[V1]
 Now praise the hidden God of love
 In whom we all must live and move,
 Who shepherds us, at every stage
 Thro’ youth, maturity, and age.
 
[V2]
 Who challenged us, when were young
 To storm the citadels of wrong;
 In care for others taught us how
 God’s true community must grow.
 
[V3]
 Who bids us never lose our zest,
 Tho’ age is urging us to rest,
 But proves to us that we have still
 A work to do, a place to fill.
 
[V4]
 Then talk no more of wasted time,
 But Godward look, and upward climb,
 Content to sleep, when day is done,
 And rise refreshed, and travel on.</lyrics>
