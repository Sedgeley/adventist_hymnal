    <lyrics>[V1]
 I cannot tell why
 He whom angels worship
 Should set His love
 upon the souls of men,
 Or why as Shepherd
 He should seek the wanderers,
 To bring them back,
 they know not how nor when.
 But this I know,
 that He was born of Mary
 When Bethlehemâ€™s manger
 was His only home,
 And that He lived
 at Nazareth and labored;
 And so the Savior,
 Savior of the world, has come.
 
[V2]
 I cannot tell how
 silently He suffered
 As with His peace
 He graced this place of tears,
 Nor how His heart
 upon the cross was broken,
 The crown of pain
 to three and thirty years.
 But this I know
 He heals the broken hearted
 And stays our sin
 and calms our lurking fear,
 And lifts the burden
 from the heavy laden;
 For still the Savior,
 Savior of the world, is here.
 
[V3]
 I cannot tell how
 He will win the nations,
 How He will claim
 His earthly heritage,
 How satisfy the
 needs and aspirations
 Of east and west,
 of sinner and of sage.
 But this I know,
 all flesh shall see His glory,
 And He shall reap
 the harvest He has sown,
 And some glad day His
 sun will shine in splendor
 When He the Savior,
 Savior, of the world, is known.
 
[V4]
 I cannot tell how
 all lands shall worship,
 When at His biding
 every storm is stilled,
 Or who can say how
 great the jubilation
 When all our hearts
 with love for Him are filled.
 But this I know the skies
 shall sound His praises,
 Ten thousand thousand
 human voices sing,
 And earth to heaven,
 and heaven to earth will answer,
 At last the Savior,
 Savior of the world, is King!</lyrics>
