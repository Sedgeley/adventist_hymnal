    <lyrics>[V1]
 This is my Father’s world,
 and to my listening ears
 all nature sings, and round me rings
 the music of the spheres.
 This is my Father’s world:
 I rest me in the thought
 of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
 his hand the wonders wrought.
 
[V2]
 This is my Father’s world,
 the birds their carols raise,
 the morning light, the lily white,
 declare their maker’s praise.
 This is my Father’s world:
 he shines in all that’s fair;
 in the rustling grass I hear him pass;
 he speaks to me everywhere.
 
[V3]
 This is my Father’s world.
 O let me ne’er forget
 that though the wrong seems oft so strong,
 God is the ruler yet.
 This is my Father’s world:
 why should my heart be sad?
 The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!
 God reigns; let the earth be glad!</lyrics>
