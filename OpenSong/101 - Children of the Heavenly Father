    <lyrics>[V1]
 Children of the heavenly Father
 Safely in His bossom gather;
 Nestling bird nor star in heaven
 Such a refuge e’er was given.
 
[V2]
 God His own doth tend and nourish,
 In His holy love they flourish;
 From all evil things He spares them,
 In His mighty arms He bears them.
 
[V3]
 Neither life nor death shall ever
 From the Lord His children sever;
 Unto them His grace He showeth,
 And their sorrows all He knoweth.
 
[V4]
 Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,
 Your Protector never slumbers;
 At the will of your Defender
 Every foe-man must surrender.
 
[V5]
 Though He giveth or He taketh,
 God His children ne’er forsaketh;
 His the loving purpose solely
 To preserve them pure and holy.</lyrics>
