    <lyrics>[V1]
 Thou didst leave Thy throne
 And Thy kingly crown
 When Thou camest to earth for me;
 But in Bethlehem’s home
 Was there found no room
 For Thy holy nativity.
 
[C]
 O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
 There is room in my heart for Thee.
 
[V2]
 Heaven’s arches rang
 When the angels sang
 Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
 But of lowly birth
 Didst Thou come to earth,
 And in greatest humility.
 
[V3]
 The foxes found rest,
 And the birds their nest
 In the shade of the forest tree;
 But Thy couch was the sod,
 O Thou Son of God,
 In the deserts of Galilee.
 
[V4]
 Thou camest, O Lord,
 With the living word
 That should set Thy people free;
 But with mocking scorn,
 And with crown of thorn,
 They bore Thee to Calvary.
 
[V5]
 When the heavens shall ring,
 And the angels sing,
 At Thy coming to victory,
 Let Thy voice call me home,
 Saying, “Yet there is room,
 There is room at My side for thee.”
 
[C]
 My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
 When Thou comest and callest for me.</lyrics>
