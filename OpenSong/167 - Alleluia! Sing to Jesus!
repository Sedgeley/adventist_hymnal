    <lyrics>[V1]
 Alleluia! sing to Jesus!
 His the scepter, His the throne.
 Alleluia! His the triumph,
 His the victory alone.
 Hark! the songs of peaceful
 Zion thunder like a mighty flood.
 Jesus out of every nation
 has redeemed us by His blood.
 
[V2]
 Alleluia! not as orphans
 are we left in sorrow now;
 Alleluia! He is near us,
 faith believes, nor questions how;
 Though the cloud from sight
 received Him when the forty days were o’er
 Shall our hearts forget His promise,
 “I am with you evermore”?
 
[V3]
 Alleluia! bread of angels,
 Thou on earth our food, our stay;
 Alleluia! here the sinful flee
 to Thee from day to day:
 Intercessor, Friend of sinners,
 Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,
 Where the songs of all the sinless
 sweep across the crystal sea.</lyrics>
