    <lyrics>[V1]
 All to Jesus I surrender;
 all to him I freely give;
 I will ever love and trust him,
 in his presence daily live.
 
[C]
 I surrender all, I surrender all,
 all to thee, my blessed Savior,
 I surrender all.
 
[V2]
 All to Jesus I surrender;
 humbly at his feet I bow,
 worldly pleasures all forsaken;
 take me, Jesus, take me now.
 
[V3]
 All to Jesus I surrender;
 make me, Savior, wholly thine;
 fill me with thy love and power;
 truly know that thou art mine.
 
[V4]
 All to Jesus I surrender;
 now I feel the sacred flame.
 O the joy of full salvation!
 Glory, glory, to his name!</lyrics>
