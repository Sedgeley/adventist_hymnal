    <lyrics>[V1]
 Father, we thank You for the light that shines all the day;
 For the bright sky You have given most like Your heaven;
 Father, we thank You.
 
[V2]
 Father, we thank You for the lamps that lighten the way;
 For human skillâ€™s exploration of Your creation;
 Father, we thank You.
 
[V3]
 Father, we thank You for the friends who brighten our play;
 For Your command to call others sisters and brothers;
 Father, we thank You.
 
[V4]
 Father, we thank You for Your love in Jesus today,
 Giving us hope for tomorrow through joy and sorrow;
 Father, we thank You.</lyrics>
