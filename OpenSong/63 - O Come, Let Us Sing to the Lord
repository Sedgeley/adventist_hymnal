    <lyrics>[V1]
 O come, let us sing to the Lord,
 Come let us every one
 A joyful noise make to the Rock
 Of our salvation.
 
[V2]
 Let us before His presence come
 With glad and thankful voice;
 Let us sing psalms of praise to Him,
 And make a joyful noise.
 
[V3]
 For God, a great God and great King,
 Above all gods, He is;
 The depths of earth are in His hand,
 The strength of hills is His.
 
[V4]
 To Him the ocean vast belongs,
 For He the sea did make;
 The dry land also from His hands,
 Its form at first did take.
 
[V5]
 O come, bow down and worship Him,
 And kneeling, humbly pray,
 Come to our Maker and our God,
 And hear His voice today.</lyrics>
