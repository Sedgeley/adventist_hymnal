    <lyrics>[V1]
 When we walk with the Lord
 in the light of his word,
 what a glory he sheds on our way!
 While we do his good will,
 he abides with us still,
 and with all who will trust and obey.
 
[C]
 Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
 to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
 
[V2]
 Not a shadow can rise,
 not a cloud in the skies,
 but his smile quickly drives it away;
 not a doubt nor a fear,
 not a sigh nor a tear,
 can abide while we trust and obey.
 
[V3]
 Not a burden we bear,
 not a sorrow we share,
 but our toil he doth richly repay;
 not a grief or a loss,
 not a frown or a cross,
 but is blest if we trust and obey.
 
[V4]
 But we never can prove
 the delights of his love
 until all on the altar we lay;
 for the favor he shows,
 and the joy he bestows,
 are for them who will trust and obey.
 
[V5]
 Then in fellowship sweet
 we will sit at his feet,
 or we’ll walk by his side in the way;
 what he says we will do,
 where he sends we will go;
 never fear, only trust and obey.</lyrics>
