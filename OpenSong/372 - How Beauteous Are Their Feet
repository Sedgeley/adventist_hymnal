    <lyrics>[V1]
 How beauteous are their feet
 Who stand on Zion’s hill;
 Who bring salvation on their tongues,
 And words of peace reveal!
 
[V2]
 How charming is their voice,
 So sweet the tidings are:
 “Zion, behold thy Savior King;
 He reigns and triumphs here!”
 
[V3]
 How happy are our ears,
 That hear the joyful sound
 Which kings and prophets waited for,
 And sought, but never found!
 
[V4]
 How blessed are our eyes,
 That see this heavenly light;
 Prophets and kings desired it long,
 But died without the sight!
 
[V5]
 The watchmen join their voice,
 And tuneful notes employ;
 Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
 And deserts learn the joy.</lyrics>
