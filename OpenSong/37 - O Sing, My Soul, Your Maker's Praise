    <lyrics>[V1]
 O sing my soul, your Maker’s praise
 In grateful hymns ascending;
 Whose steadfast love has crowned your days
 With heav’nly gifts un ending.
 I sought the Lord, He heard my cry;
 His holy angels hover nigh
 The tents of those who love Him.
 
[V2]
 The Lord is good to those who seek
 His face in time of sorrow,
 Providing comfort to the weak
 And grace for each tomorrow.
 Though grief may tarry for a night,
 The morn shall break in joy and light
 With blessings from His presence.
 
[V3]
 The Lord will turn His face in peace
 When troubled souls draw near Him;
 His loving kindness shall not cease
 To those who trust and fear Him.
 Our God will not forsake His own;
 Eternal is His heav’nly throne;
 His kingdom stands forever.</lyrics>
