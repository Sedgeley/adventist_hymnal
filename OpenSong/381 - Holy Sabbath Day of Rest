    <lyrics>[V1]
 Holy Sabbath day of rest,
 By our Master richly blest,
 God created and divine,
 Set aside for holy time.
 
[C]
 Yes, the holy Sabbath rest,
 By our God divinely blest,
 It to us a sign shall be
 Throughout all eternity.
 
[V2]
 Seek not pleasures of this earth,
 With its folly, noise, and mirth,
 There are better things in store,
 Over on the other shore.
 
[V3]
 As the Sabbath draweth on
 Friday eve at set of sun,
 Christian household then should meet,
 Sing and pray at Jesus’feet.
 
[V4]
 Asking Him for saving grace,
 Also vict’ry in the race,
 And to help us by His pow’r,
 To keep holy every hour.</lyrics>
