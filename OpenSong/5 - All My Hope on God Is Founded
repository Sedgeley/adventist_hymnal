    <lyrics>[V1]
 All my hope on God is founded;
 He doth still my trust renew.
 Me through change and chance He guideth,
 Only good and only true.
 God unknown, He alone
 Calls my heart to be His own.
 
[V2]
 Pride of man and earthly glory,
 Sword and crown betray his trust;
 What with care and toil he buildeth,
 Tower and temple fall to dust.
 But God’s power, hour by hour,
 Is my temple and my tower.
 
[V3]
 God’s great goodness aye endureth,
 Deep His wisdom, passing thought;
 Splendor, light and life attend Him,
 Beauty springeth out of naught.
 Love doth stand at His hand;
 Joy doth wait on His command.
 
[V4]
 Still from man to God eternal,
 Sacrifice of praise be done.
 High above all praises praising,
 For the gift of Christ His son.
 Christ doth call one and all:
 Ye who follow shall not fall.</lyrics>
