    <lyrics>[V1]
 You that know the Lord is gracious,
 You for whom a cornerstone
 Stands, of God elect and precious,
 Laid that you may build there-on,
 See that on that sure foundation
 You a living temple raise.
 Towers that may tell forth salvation,
 Walls that may reech-o praise.
 
[V2]
 Living stones by God appointed
 Each to his allotted place,
 Kings and priests, by God anointed,
 Shall you not declare His grace?
 You, a royal generation,
 Tell the tidings of your birth,
 Tidings of a new creation
 To an old and weary earth.
 
[V3]
 Tell the praise of Him who called you
 Out of darkness into light,
 Broke the fetters that enthralled you,
 Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:
 Tell the tale of sins forgiven,
 Strength renewed and hope restored,
 Till the earth, in tune with heaven,
 Praise and magnify the Lord.</lyrics>
