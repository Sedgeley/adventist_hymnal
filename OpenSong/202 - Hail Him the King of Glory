    <lyrics>[V1]
 Tell it to every kindred and nation,
 Tell it far and near;
 Earth’s darkest night will fade with the dawning,
 Jesus will soon appear.
 
[C]
 Hail Him the King of glory,
 Once the Lamb for sinners slain;
 Tell, tell the wondrous story,
 “Jesus comes to reign.”
 
[V2]
 Nations again in strife and commotion,
 Warnings by the way;
 Signs in the heavens, unerring omens,
 Herald the glorious day.
 
[V3]
 Children of God look up with rejoicing;
 Shout and sing His praise;
 Blessèd are they who, waiting and watching,
 Look for the dawning rays.</lyrics>
