    <lyrics>[V1]
 I’d rather have Jesus
 than silver or gold;
 I’d rather be His
 than have riches untold;
 I’d rather have Jesus
 than houses or land;
 I’d rather be led
 by His nail-pierced hand:
 
[C]
 Than to be the king of a vast domain
 or be held in sin’s dread sway!
 I’d rather have Jesus than anything
 this world affords today.
 
[V2]
 I’d rather have Jesus
 than men’s applause;
 I’d rather be faithful
 to His dear cause;
 I’d rather have Jesus
 than world-wide fame;
 I’d rather be true
 to His holy name:
 
[V3]
 He’s fairer than lilies
 of rarest bloom;
 He’s sweeter than honey
 from out the comb;
 He’s all that my hungering
 spirit needs
 I’d rather have Jesus
 and let Him lead:</lyrics>
