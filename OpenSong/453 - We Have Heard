    <lyrics>[V1]
 We have heard from the bright, the holy, land;
 We have heard, and our hearts are glad;
 For we were a lonely pilgrim band,
 And weary, and worn, and sad.
 They tell us the saints have a dwelling there-
 No longer are homeless ones;
 And we know that the goodly land is fair,
 Where life’s pure river runs.
 
[V2]
 They say green fields are waving there,
 That never a blight shall know;
 And the deserts wild are blooming fair,
 And the roses of Sharon grow.
 There are lovely birds in the bowers green,
 Their songs are blithe and sweet;
 And their warblings, gushing ever new,
 The angels’ harpings greet.
 
[V3]
 We have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns,
 And the silvery band in white;
 Of the city fair, with pearly gates,
 All radiant with light.
 We have heard of the angels there, and saints,
 With their harps of gold, how they sing;
 Of the mount with the fruitful tree of life,
 Of the leaves that healing bring.
 
[V4]
 The King of that country, He is fair,
 He’s the joy and light of the place;
 In His beauty we shall behold Him there,
 And bask in His smiling face,
 We’ll be there, we’ll be there in a little while,
 We’ll join the pure and the blest;
 We’ll have the palm, the robe, the crown,
 And forever be at rest.</lyrics>
