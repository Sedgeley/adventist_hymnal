    <lyrics>[V1]
 Teach, me, Father, what to say;
 Teach me, Father, how to pray;
 Teach me all along the way
 How to be like Jesus.
 
[C]
 I would be like Jesus,
 I would be like Jesus!
 Help me, Lord, to daily grow
 More and more like Jesus!
 
[V2]
 Teach me as the days go by,
 Teach me not to reason why,
 Teach me that to do and die,
 Is to be like Jesus.
 
[V3]
 Teach me that the time is short,
 Teach me how to live and work,
 Teach me that to never shirk
 Is to be like Jesus.
 
[V4]
 Teach me how we may be one,
 Like the Father and the Son;
 And when all is overcome,
 I will be like Jesus.</lyrics>
