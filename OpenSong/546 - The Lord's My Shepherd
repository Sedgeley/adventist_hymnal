    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not want
 He makes me down to lie
 In pastures green; he leadeth me
 The quiet waters by.
 He leadeth me, He leadeth me
 The quiet waters by.
 
[V2]
 My soul he doth restore again
 And me to walk doth make
 Within the paths of righteousness
 Even for his own name’s sake.
 Within the paths of righteousness
 Even for his own name’s sake.
 
[V3]
 Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale
 Yet will I fear no ill
 For thou art with me, and thy rod
 And staff me comfort still.
 For thou art with me, and thy rod
 And staff me comfort still.
 
[V4]
 My table thou has furnished
 In presence of my foes;
 My head thou dost with oil anoint
 And my cup overflows.
 My head thou dost with oil anoint
 And my cup overflows.
 
[V5]
 Goodness and mercy all my life
 Shall surely follow me,
 And in God’s house for evermore
 My dwelling-place shall be.
 And in God’s house for evermore
 My dwelling-place shall be.</lyrics>
