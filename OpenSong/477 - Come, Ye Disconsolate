    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, ye disconsolate, where’er ye languish.
 come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel.
 Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
 earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.
 
[V2]
 Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,
 hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!
 Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
 “Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.”
 
[V3]
 Here see the bread of life; waters flowing
 forth from the throne of God, pure from above.
 Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing
 earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.</lyrics>
