    <lyrics>[V1]
 Sweet promise is given to all who believe–
 “Behold I come quickly, Mine own to receive;
 Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
 Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait.”
 
[C]
 “Hold fast till I come,” sweet promise of heaven–
 “The kingdom restored, to you shall be given.”
 “Come, enter My joy, sit down on the throne;
 Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come.”
 
[V2]
 We’ll “watch unto prayer” with lamps burning bright;
 He comes to all others a “thief in the night.”
 We know He is near, but know not the day–
 As spring shows that summer is not far away.
 
[V3]
 Yes! this is our hope, ’tis built on His word–
 The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
 Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
 “Behold I come quickly; hold fast till I come.”</lyrics>
