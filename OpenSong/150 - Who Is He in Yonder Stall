    <lyrics>[V1]
 Who is He in yonder stall,
 At whose feet the shepherds fall?
 
[C]
 ‘Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
 ‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
 At His feet we humbly fall,
 Crown Him, crown Him Lord of all.
 At His feet we humbly fall- the Lord of all.
 Crown Him, crown Him, Jesus, Jesus,
 Crown Him Lord of all.
 
[V2]
 Who is He in deep distress,
 Fasting in the wilderness?
 
[V3]
 Who is He, the gathering throng
 Greet with loud triumphant song?
 
[V4]
 Lo, at midnight, who is He
 Prays in dark Gethsemane?
 
[V5]
 Who is He on yonder tree
 Dies in shame and agony?
 
[V6]
 Who is He that from the grave
 Comes to heal and help and save?
 
 7
 Who is He that from His throne
 Rules through all the world alone?</lyrics>
