    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, who dost give
 to Thy church for its healing
 Gifts, and the grace
 to sustain and renew,
 Hear as we pray that
 today and each morrow
 We to Thy purpose may
 show ourselves true.
 
[V2]
 Clear be the voices
 of preachers and prophets
 Fearlessly speaking
 the word of the Lord,
 Word of redemption
 thro‘ God’s Son incarnate,
 Blessing for cursing,
 and peace for the sword.
 
[V3]
 Tender and wise be
 the hearts of the pastors,
 Guiding and guarding
 the souls in their care,
 Firm with the wayward,
 a strength to the doubting,
 Helping the needy
 their burdens to bear.
 
[V4]
 May those who teach grow
 in knowledge and patience,
 Guiding to wisdom
 the young and the old,
 Training for worship
 and witness and service,
 Foes to all falsehood,
 in truthfulness bold.
 
[V5]
 Lord, ever give to us
 gifts in due measure,
 Each needing other,
 and all having worth;
 So to the Father,
 the Son, and the Spirit,
 Glory be shown by
 the church here on earth.</lyrics>
