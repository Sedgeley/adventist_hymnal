    <lyrics>[V1]
 I would draw nearer to Jesus,
 In His sweet presence abide,
 Constantly trying to serve Him,
 Safe and secure at His side.
 I would draw nearer to Jesus,
 I would draw nearer to Him;
 Fully surrendered each moment,
 I would draw nearer to Him.
 
[V2]
 I would draw nearer to Jesus,
 Nothing withholding from Him,
 Knowing He loves to be gracious,
 I would draw nearer to Him.
 I would draw nearer to Jesus,
 I would draw nearer to Him;
 Fully surrendered each moment,
 I would draw nearer to Him.
 
[V3]
 I would draw nearer to Jesus,
 Seeking Hi strength to be true,
 Willing to tell of His goodness,
 Gladly His blest will to do.
 I would draw nearer to Jesus,
 I would draw nearer to Him;
 Fully surrendered each moment,
 I would draw nearer to Him.</lyrics>
