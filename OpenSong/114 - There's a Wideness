    <lyrics>[V1]
 There’s a wideness, in God’s mercy,
 like the wideness of the sea;
 There is mercy, with the Savior,
 Which is more than liberty.
 
[V2]
 There is welcome, for the sinner,
 and more graces for the good;
 There is mercy, with the Savior,
 There is healing in His blood.
 
[V3]
 For the love of God is broader
 Than the measure of man’s mind.
 And the heart of the Eternal,
 is most wonderfully kind.
 
[V4]
 If our love were but more simple,
 We should take Him at His word;
 And our lives would be all sunshine,
 In the sweetness of our Lord.</lyrics>
