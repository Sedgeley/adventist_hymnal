    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus is all the world to me,
 my life, my joy, my all;
 he is my strength from day to day,
 without him I would fall.
 When I am sad, to him I go,
 no other one can cheer me so;
 when I am sad, he makes me glad,
 he’s my friend.
 
[V2]
 Jesus is all the world to me,
 my friend in trials sore;
 I go to him for blessings, and
 he gives them o’er and o’er.
 He sends the sunshine and the rain,
 he sends the harvest’s golden grain;
 sunshine and rain, harvest of grain,
 he’s my friend.
 
[V3]
 Jesus is all the world to me,
 and true to him I’ll be;
 O how could I this friend deny,
 when he’s so true to me?
 Following him I know I’m right,
 he watches o’er me day and night;
 following him by day and night,
 he’s my friend.
 
[V4]
 Jesus is all the world to me,
 I want no better friend;
 I trust him now, I’ll trust him when
 life’s fleeting days shall end.
 Beautiful life with such a friend,
 beautiful life that has no end;
 eternal life, eternal joy,
 he’s my friend.</lyrics>
