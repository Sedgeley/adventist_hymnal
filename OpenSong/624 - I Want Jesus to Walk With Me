    <lyrics>[V1]
 I want Jesus to walk with me.
 (walk with me)
 I want Jesus to walk with me.
 (walk with me)
 All along my pilgrim journey,
 I want Jesus to walk with me.
 (walk with me)
 
[V2]
 In my trials, Lord walk with me.
 (walk with me)
 In my trials, Lord walk with me.
 (walk with me)
 When the shades of life are falling,
 I want Jesus to walk with me.
 (walk with me)
 
[V3]
 In my sorrows, Lord walk with me.
 (walk with me)
 In my sorrows, Lord walk with me.
 (walk with me)
 When my heart within is aching,
 I want Jesus to walk with me.
 (walk with me)</lyrics>
