    <lyrics>[V1]
 Blessed Jesus, at Thy word,
 We have gathered all to hear Thee;
 By Thy word our hearts were stirred,
 Now to seek and love and fear Thee.
 By Thy teachings sweet and holy,
 Let us learn to love Thee solely.
 
[V2]
 All our knowledge, sense, and sight,
 Lie in deepest darkness shrouded;
 Till Thy Spirit breaks our night,
 With His beams of truth unclouded.
 He alone to God canst win us,
 He who works all good within us.
 
[V3]
 Glorious Lord, Thy self impart!
 Light of light, from God proceeding.
 Open Thou our ears and heart
 Help us, by Thy Spiritâ€™s pleading.
 Hear the cry Thy people raises!
 Hear, and bless our prayer and praises!</lyrics>
