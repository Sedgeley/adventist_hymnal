    <lyrics>[V1]
 Take the Name of Jesus with you,
 Child of sorrow and of woe,
 It will joy and comfort give you;
 Take it then, where’er you go.
 
[C]
 Precious Name, O how sweet!
 Hope of earth and joy of Heav’n.
 Precious Name, O how sweet!
 Hope of earth and joy of Heav’n.
 
[V2]
 Take the Name of Jesus ever,
 As a shield from every snare;
 If temptations round you gather,
 Breathe that holy Name in prayer.
 
[V3]
 O the precious Name of Jesus!
 How it thrills our souls with joy,
 When His loving arms receive us,
 And His songs our tongues employ!
 
[V4]
 At the Name of Jesus bowing,
 Falling prostrate at His feet,
 King of kings in heav’n we’ll crown Him,
 When our journey is complete.</lyrics>
