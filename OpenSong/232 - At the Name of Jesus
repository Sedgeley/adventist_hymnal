    <lyrics>[V1]
 At the name of Jesus
 every knee shall bow,
 Every tongue confess
 Him King of glory now;
 “Tis the Father’s pleasure
 we should call Him Lord,
 Who from the beginning
 was the mighty Word.
 
[V2]
 At His voice creation
 sprang at once to sight,
 All the angel faces,
 All the hosts of light,
 Thrones and dominations
 stars upon their way,
 All the heavenly orders
 in their great array.
 
[V3]
 Humbled for a season,
 To receive a name
 From the lips of sinners,
 Unto whom He came;
 He is God the Savior,
 He is Christ the Lord,
 Ever to be worshiped,
 Trusted and adored.
 
[V4]
 In your hearts enthrone Him:
 There let Him subdue
 All that is not holy,
 All that is not true;
 Crown Him as your captain
 in temptation’s hour,
 Let His will enfold you
 in its light and power.
 
[V5]
 Surely, this Lord Jesus
 shall return again,
 With His Father’s glory,
 With His angel train;
 For all wreaths of empire
 meet upon His brow,
 And our hearts confess
 Him King of glory now.</lyrics>
