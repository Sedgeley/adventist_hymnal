    <lyrics>[V1]
 Once in royal Davidâ€™s city
 Stood a lowly cattle shed,
 Where a mother laid her Baby
 In a manger for His bed;
 Mary was that mother mild,
 Jesus Christ her little Child.
 
[V2]
 He came down to earth from heaven,
 Who is God and Lord of all,
 And His shelter was a stable,
 And His cradle was a stall;
 With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
 Lived on earth our Savior holy.
 
[V3]
 And through all His wondrous childhood
 He would honor and obey,
 Love and watch the lowly mother
 In whose gentle arms He lay.
 Christian children all must be
 Mild, obedient, good as He.
 
[V4]
 And our eyes at last shall see Him,
 Through His own redeeming love;
 For that Child so dear and gentle
 Is our Lord in heaven above;
 And He leads His children on
 To the place where He is gone.</lyrics>
