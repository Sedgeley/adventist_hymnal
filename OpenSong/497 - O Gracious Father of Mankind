    <lyrics>[V1]
 O gracious Father of mankind,
 Our spirits’ unseen friend;
 High heaven’s Lord, our hearts’ dear guest,
 To Thee our prayers ascend.
 
[V2]
 Thou dost not wait till human speech
 Thy gifts divine implore;
 Our dreams, our aims, our work, our lives
 Are prayers Thou lovest more.
 
[V3]
 Thou hearest these, the good and ill,
 Deep buried in each breast;
 The secret thought, the hidden plan,
 Wrought out our unexpressed.
 
[V4]
 O cleanse our prayers from human dross,
 Attune our lives to Thee,
 Until we labor for those gifts
 We ask on bended knee.
 
[V5]
 Our best is but Thyself in us,
 Our highest thought Thy will;
 To hear Thy voice we need but love,
 And listen, and be still.
 
[V6]
 We would not bend Thy will to ours,
 But blend our wills to Thine;
 Not dreams, our aims, our work, our lives
 Are prayers Thou lovest more.
 
 7
 Thou seekest us in love and truth
 More than our minds seek Thee;
 Through open gates Thy power flows in
 Like flood tides from the sea.
 
 8
 No more we seek Thee from afar,
 Nor ask Thee for a sign,
 Content to pray in life and love
 And toil, till all are Thine.</lyrics>
