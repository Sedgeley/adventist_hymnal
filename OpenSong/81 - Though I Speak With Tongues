    <lyrics>[V1]
 Though I speak with tongues of men and angels,
 Though I have the prophet’s gift,
 Though I hold the keys to hidden knowledge,
 Though my faith can mountains shift;
 Without love I am no better,
 Without love it’s all for naught;
 Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:
 What this means I would be taught.
 
[V2]
 Love is patient, knows no envy,
 Never gloats when others sin;
 Love is never glad to see injustice,
 Always wants the truth to win.
 There’s no end to love’s endurance,
 There’s no test it cannot face;
 Lord, You spent Your life in loving others:
 I shall fail without Your grace.
 
[V3]
 Though there’ll be an end to hidden knowledge,
 Visions, raptures, prophecy:
 Faith and hope and love shall last forever,
 Love the greatest of the three.
 Without love I am no better,
 Without love it’s all for naught;
 Lord, You gave Your life in saving others:
 What this means I would be taught.</lyrics>
