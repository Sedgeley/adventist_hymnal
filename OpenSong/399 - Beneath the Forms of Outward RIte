    <lyrics>[V1]
 Beneath the forms of outward rite
 Thy supper, Lord, is spread
 In every quiet upper room
 Where fainting souls are fed.
 
[V2]
 The bread is always consecrate
 Which men divide with men;
 And every act of brotherhood
 Repeats Thy feast again.
 
[V3]
 The blessed cup is only passed
 True memory of Thee,
 When life anew pours out its wine
 With rich sufficiency.
 
[V4]
 O Master, through these symbols shared,
 Thine own dear self impart,
 That in our daily life may flame
 The passion of Thy heart.</lyrics>
