    <lyrics>[V1]
 Dear Lord, we come at set of sun,
 And at Your feet we kneel
 To worship You, Creator, King,
 This day, Your sign and seal.
 
[V2]
 Our earthly tasks we lay aside,
 According to Your Word,
 To enter now Your holy rest,
 The Sabbath of the Lord.
 
[V3]
 Sweet Sabbath rest, your sacred hours
 Are as a golden chain
 That reaches back to Edenâ€™s gate
 And points us home again.
 
[V4]
 And when this earth shall be renewed,
 And sin and death destroyed,
 Shall all redeemed each Sabbath day
 Still meet to praise their God.</lyrics>
