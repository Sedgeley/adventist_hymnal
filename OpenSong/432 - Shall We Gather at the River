    <lyrics>[V1]
 Shall we gather at the river,
 where bright angel feet have trod,
 with its crystal tide forever
 flowing by the throne of God?
 
[C]
 Yes, we’ll gather at the river,
 the beautiful, the beautiful river;
 gather with the saints at the river
 that flows by the throne of God.
 
[V2]
 On the margin of the river,
 washing up its silver spray,
 we will walk and worship ever,
 all the happy golden day.
 
[V3]
 Ere we reach the shining river,
 lay we every burden down;
 grace our spirits will deliver,
 and provide a robe and crown.
 
[V4]
 Soon we’ll reach the shining river,
 soon our pilgrimage will cease;
 soon our happy hearts will quiver
 with the melody of peace.</lyrics>
