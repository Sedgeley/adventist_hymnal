    <lyrics>[V1]
 Spirit of God,
 descend upon my heart;
 wean it from earth;
 through all its pulses move;
 stoop to my weakness,
 mighty as thou art,
 and make me love thee
 as I ought to love.
 
[V2]
 I ask no dream,
 no prophet ecstasies,
 no sudden rending
 of the veil of clay,
 no angel visitant,
 no opening skies;
 but take the dimness
 of my soul away.
 
[V3]
 Has thou not bid me love
 thee, God and King?
 All, all thine own, soul,
 heart and strength and mind.
 I see thy cross;
 there teach my heart to cling.
 O let me seek thee,
 and O let me find.
 
[V4]
 Teach me to feel
 that thou art always nigh;
 teach me the struggles
 of the soul to bear.
 To check the rising doubt,
 the rebel sigh,
 teach me the patience
 of unanswered prayer.
 
[V5]
 Teach me to love thee
 as thine angels love,
 one holy passion
 filling all my frame;
 the kindling of the
 heaven-descended Dove,
 my heart an altar,
 and thy love the flame.</lyrics>
