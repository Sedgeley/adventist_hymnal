    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord of creation,
 to you be all praise!
 Most mighty your working,
 most wondrous your ways!
 Your glory and might
 are beyond us to tell,
 And yet in the heart
 of the humble you dwell.
 
[V2]
 Lord of all power,
 I give you my will,
 In joyful obedience
 your tasks to fulfill.
 Your bondage is freedom;
 your service is song;
 And held in your keeping,
 my weakness is strong.
 
[V3]
 Lord of all wisdom,
 I give you my mind,
 Rich truth that surpasses
 man’s knowledge to find;
 What eye has not seen
 and what ear has not heard
 Is taught by your spirit
 and shines from your word.
 
[V4]
 Lord of all being,
 I give you my all,
 If I ever disown you,
 I stumble and fall;
 But led in your service
 your word to obey,
 I’ll walk in your freedom
 to the end of the way.</lyrics>
