    <lyrics>[V1]
 Just as I am, without one plea,
 but that thy blood was shed for me,
 and that thou bidst me come to thee,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V2]
 Just as I am, and waiting not
 to rid my soul of one dark blot,
 to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V3]
 Just as I am, though tossed about
 with many a conflict, many a doubt,
 fightings and fears within, without,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V4]
 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
 sight, riches, healing of the mind,
 yea, all I need in thee to find,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V5]
 Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
 wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
 because thy promise I believe,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V6]
 Just as I am, thy love I own
 hath broken every barrier down;
 now, to be thine, and thine alone,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</lyrics>
