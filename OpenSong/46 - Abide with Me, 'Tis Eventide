    <lyrics>[V1]
 Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
 The day is past and gone;
 The shadows of the evening fall;
 The night is coming on!
 Within my heart a welcome guest,
 Within my home abide;
 
[C]
 O Savior, stay this night with me;
 Behold, ’tis eventide!
 O Savior, stay this night with me;
 Behold, ’tis eventide.
 
[V2]
 Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
 Thy walk today with me
 Has made my heart within me burn,
 As I communed with Thee.
 Thy earnest words have filled my soul
 And kept me near Thy side;
 
[V3]
 Abide with me, ’tis eventide!
 And lone will be the night,
 If I cannot commune with Thee,
 Nor find in Thee my light.
 The darkness of the world, I fear,
 Would in my home abide;</lyrics>
