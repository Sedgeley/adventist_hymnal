    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, ye thankful people, come,
 Raise the song of harvest home;
 All is safely gathered in,
 Ere the winter storms begin.
 God our Maker doth provide
 For our wants to be supplied;
 Come to God’s own temple, come;
 Raise the song of harvest home!
 
[V2]
 We ourselves are God’s own field,
 Fruit unto His praise to yield;
 Wheat and tares together sown,
 Unto joy or sorrow grown;
 First the blade and then the ear,
 Then the full corn shall appear;
 Grant, O harvest Lord, that we
 Wholesome grain and pure may be.
 
[V3]
 For the Lord our God shall come,
 And shall take His harvest home;
 From His field shall purge away
 All that doth offend, that day;
 Give His angels charge at last
 In the fire the tares to cast;
 But the fruitful ears to store
 In His garner evermore.
 
[V4]
 Then, thou church triumphant, come,
 Raise the song of harvest home;
 All are safely gathered in,
 Free from sorrow, free from sin,
 There, forever purified,
 In God’s garner to abide;
 Come, ten thousand angels, come,
 Raise the glorious harvest home!</lyrics>
