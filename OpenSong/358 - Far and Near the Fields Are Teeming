    <lyrics>[V1]
 Far and near the fields are teeming
 with the sheaves of ripened grain;
 Far and near their gold is gleaming
 O’er the summy slope and plain.
 
[C]
 Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
 Hear us Lord,to Thee we cry;
 Send them now the sheaves to gather,
 Ere the harvest-time pass by.
 
[V2]
 Send them forth with morn’s first beaming,
 Send them in the noon-tides’s glare;
 When the sun’s last rays are streaming,
 bid them gather everywhere.
 
[V3]
 O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
 gather now the sheaves of gold;
 Heavenward then at evening wending
 Thou shalt come with joy untold.</lyrics>
