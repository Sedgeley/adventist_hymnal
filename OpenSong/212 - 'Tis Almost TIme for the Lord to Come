    <lyrics>[V1]
 â€™Tis almost time for the Lord to come,
 I hear the people say;
 The stars of heaven are growing dim,
 It must be the breaking of the day.
 
[C]
 O it must be the breaking of the day!
 O it must be the breaking of the day!
 The night is almost gone,
 The day is coming on;
 O it must be the breaking of the day!
 
[V2]
 The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
 In earth and sea and sky,
 Aloud proclaim to all mankind,
 The coming of the Master draweth nigh.
 
[V3]
 It must be time for the waiting church
 To cast her pride away,
 With girded loins and burning lamps,
 To look for the breaking of the day.
 
[V4]
 Go quickly out in the streets and lanes
 And in the broad highway,
 And call the maimed, the halt, and blind,
 To be ready for the breaking of the day.</lyrics>
