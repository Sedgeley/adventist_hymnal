    <lyrics>[V1]
 Stand up, stand up for Jesus!
 ye soldiers of the cross;
 Lift high His royal banner,
 it must not suffer loss:
 From vict’ry unto vict’ry,
 His army shall He lead,
 Till every foe is vanquished,
 and Christ is Lord indeed.
 
[V2]
 Stand up, stand up for Jesus!
 The trumpet call obey:
 Forth to the mighty conflict,
 in this His glorious day;
 Ye that are men now serve Him
 against unnumbered foes;
 Let courage rise with danger,
 and strength to strength oppose.
 
[V3]
 Stand up, stand up for Jesus!
 Stand in His strength alone,
 The arm of flesh will fail you,
 ye dare not trust your own;
 Put on the gospel armor,
 and watching unto prayer,
 Where calls the voice of duty,
 be never wanting there.
 
[V4]
 Stand up, stand up for Jesus!
 the strife will not be long;
 This day the noise of battle,
 the next the victor’s song;
 To him that overcometh
 a crown of life shall be;
 He with the King of glory
 shall reign eternally.</lyrics>
