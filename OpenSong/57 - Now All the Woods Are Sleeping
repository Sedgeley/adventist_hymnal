    <lyrics>[V1]
 Now all the woods are sleeping,
 And night and stillness creeping
 O’er city, man, and beast;
 But thou, my heart, awake thee,
 To pray’r awhile be take thee,
 And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.
 
[V2]
 My Jesus, stay Thou by me,
 And let no foe come nigh me,
 Safe sheltered by Thy wing;
 But would the foe alarm me,
 O let him never harm me,
 But still Thine angels round me sing!
 
[V3]
 My loved ones, rest securely,
 From every peril surely
 Our God will guard your heads;
 And happy slumbers send you,
 And bid His hosts attend you,
 And golden armed watch o’er your beds.</lyrics>
