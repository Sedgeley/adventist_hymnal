    <lyrics>[V1]
 In times like these you need a Savior,
 In times like these you need and anchor;
 Be very sure, be very sure
 Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!
 This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He’s the One;
 This Rock is Jesus, The only One!
 Be very sure, be very sure
 Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!
 
[V2]
 In times like these you need the Bible,
 In times like these O be not idle;
 Be very sure, be very sure
 Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!
 This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He’s the One;
 This Rock is Jesus, The only One!
 Be very sure, be very sure
 Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!
 
[V3]
 In times like these I have a Savior,
 In times like these I have an anchor
 I’m very sure, be very sure
 Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!
 This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He’s the One;
 This Rock is Jesus, The only One!
 I’m very sure, be very sure
 Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!</lyrics>
