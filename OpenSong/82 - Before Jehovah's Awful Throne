    <lyrics>[V1]
 Before Jehovah’s awful throne,
 Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;
 Know that the Lord is God alone;
 He can create, and He destroy.
 
[V2]
 His sovereign power, without our aid,
 Made us of clay, and formed us men;
 and when like wandering sheep we strayed,
 He brought us to His fold again.
 
[V3]
 We’ll crowd His gates with thankful songs,
 High as the heavens our voices raise;
 And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
 Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.
 
[V4]
 Wide as the world is His command,
 Vast as Eternity His love;
 Firm as a rock His truth shall stand,
 When rolling years shall cease to move.</lyrics>
