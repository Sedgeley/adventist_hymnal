    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Son of God proclaim,
 The Lord of time and space;
 The God who bade the light break forth
 Now shines in Jesus’ face.
 
[V2]
 Behold His out stretched hands,
 Though all was in His power
 He took the towel and basin then,
 And serves us in this hour.
 
[V3]
 He, God’s creative word,
 The church’s Lord and head,
 Here bids us gather as His friends,
 And share His wine and bread.
 
[V4]
 The Lord of life and death
 With wondering praise we sing;
 We break the bread at His command,
 And name Him God and King.
 
[V5]
 We take this cup in hope:
 For He, who gladly bore
 The shameful cross, is ris’n again,
 And reigns forevermore.</lyrics>
