    <lyrics>[V1]
 We give this child to You,
 Our precious gift of love.
 Help us to lead each step aright
 With guidance from above.
 
[V2]
 O bless each child of Yours,
 And grant when they are grown,
 They will have learned to love Your way,
 And choose it for their own.
 
[V3]
 We give ourselves to You,
 And may Your Spirit fill
 Our hearts and home, that all we do
 Be subject to Your will.</lyrics>
