    <lyrics>[V1]
 O God of light, Your Word,
 a lamp unfailing,
 Shall pierce the darkness
 of our earthbound way
 And show Your grace,
 Your plan for us unveiling,
 And guide our footsteps
 to the perfect day.
 
[V2]
 From days of old,
 through blind and willful ages,
 Though we rebelled,
 You gently sought again,
 And spoke through saints,
 Apostles, prophets, sages,
 Who wrote with eager
 or reluctant pen.
 
[V3]
 Undimmed by time,
 those words are still revealing
 To sinful hearts
 Your justice and Your grace;
 And questing mortals
 longing for Your healing,
 See Your compassion
 in the Saviorâ€™s face.
 
[V4]
 To all the world Your
 summons You are sending,
 Through all the earth,
 to ever land and race,
 That myriad tongues,
 in one great anthem blending,
 May praise and celebrate
 Your gift of grace.</lyrics>
