    <lyrics>[V1]
 Like a river glorious,
 is Godâ€™s perfect peace,
 Over all victorious,
 in its bright increase;
 Perfect, yet it floweth,
 fuller every day,
 Perfect, yet it groweth,
 deeper all the way.
 
[C]
 Stayed upon Jehovah,
 hearts are fully blessed
 Finding, as He promised,
 perfect peace and rest.
 
[V2]
 Hidden in the hollow
 of His blessed hand,
 Never foe can follow,
 never traitor stand;
 Not a surge of worry,
 not a shade of care,
 Not a blast of hurry
 touch the spirit there.
 
[V3]
 Every joy or trial
 falleth from above,
 Traced upon our dial
 by the Sun of Love;
 We may trust Him fully
 all for us to do.
 They who trust Him wholly
 find Him wholly true.</lyrics>
