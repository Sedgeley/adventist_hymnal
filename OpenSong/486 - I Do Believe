    <lyrics>[V1]
 Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;
 No other help I know;
 If Thou withdraw Thyself from me,
 Ah, wither shall I go?
 
[V2]
 On Thy dear Son I now believe,
 O let me feel Thy power;
 And all my varied wants relieve,
 In this accepted hour.
 
[V3]
 Author of faith! To Thee I lift
 My weary, longing eyes;
 O let me now receive that gift;
 My soul without it dies.
 
[V4]
 Surely Thou canst not let me die;
 O speak, and I shall live;
 And here I will unwearied lie,
 Till Thou Thy Spirit give.
 
[V5]
 How would my fainting soul rejoice
 Could I but see Thy face!
 Now let me hear Thy quickening voice,
 And taste Thy pardoning grace.
 
[V6]
 I do believe, I now believe
 That Jesus died for me,
 And that He shed His precious blood
 From sin to set me free.</lyrics>
