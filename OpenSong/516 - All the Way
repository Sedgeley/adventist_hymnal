    <lyrics>[V1]
 All the way my Savior leads me;
 What have I to ask beside?
 Can I doubt His tender mercy,
 Who through life has been my guide?
 Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
 Here by faith in Him to dwell;
 For I know whate’er befall me,
 Jesus doeth all things well;
 For I know whate’er befall me,
 Jesus doeth all things well.
 
[V2]
 All the way my Savior leads me;
 Cheers each winding path I tread;
 Gives me grace for every trial,
 Feeds me with the living bread;
 Though my weary steps may falter,
 And my soul athirst may be,
 Gushing from the Rock before me,
 Lo, a spring of joy I see;
 Gushing from the Rock before me,
 Lo, a spring of joy I see.
 
[V3]
 All the way my Savior leads me;
 O the fullness of His love!
 Perfect rest to me is promised
 In my Father’s house above;
 When I wake to life immortal,
 Wing my flight to realms of day,
 This my song through endless ages,
 Jesus led me all the way;
 This my song through endless ages,
 Jesus led me all the way.</lyrics>
