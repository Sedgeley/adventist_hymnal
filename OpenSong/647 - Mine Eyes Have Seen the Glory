    <lyrics>[V1]
 Mine eyes have seen the glory
 of the coming of the Lord;
 He is trampling out the vintage
 where the grapes of wrath are stored;
 He has loosed the fateful lightning
 of His terrible swift sword;
 His truth is marching on.
 
[C]
 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
 His truth is marching on.
 
[V2]
 He has sounded forth the trumpet
 that shall never call retreat;
 He is sifting out the hearts of men
 before His judgment seat;
 O be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
 be jubilant, my feet!
 Our God is marching on.
 
[V3]
 In the beauty of the lilies
 Christ was born across the sea,
 With a glory in His bosom
 that transfigures you and me;
 As He died to make men holy,
 let us live to make men free!
 While God is marching on.</lyrics>
