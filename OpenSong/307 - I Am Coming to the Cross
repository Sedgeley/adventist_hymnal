    <lyrics>[V1]
 I am coming to the cross;
 I am poor and weak and blind;
 I am counting all but dross;
 I shall full salvation find.
 
[C]
 I am trusting, Lord, in Thee.
 O thou Lamb of Calvary;
 Humbly at Thy cross I bow.
 Save me, Jesus, save me now.
 
[V2]
 Long my heart has sighed for Thee;
 Long has evil reigned within;
 Jesus sweetly speaks to me:
 “I will cleanse you from all sin.”
 
[V3]
 Here I give my all to Thee:
 Friends and time and earthly store;
 Soul and body Thine to be,
 Wholly Thine forevermore.
 
[V4]
 Jesus comes! He fills my soul!
 Perfected in Him I am;
 I am every whit made whole:
 Glory, glory to the Lamb!</lyrics>
