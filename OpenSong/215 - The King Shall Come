    <lyrics>[V1]
 The King shall come when morning dawns
 And light triumphant breaks,
 When beauty gilds the eastern hills
 And life to joy awakes.
 
[V2]
 Not as of old a little child,
 To bear and fight and die,
 But crowned with glory like the sun
 That lights the morning sky.
 
[V3]
 O, brighter than that rising morn
 When Christ, victorious, rose
 And left the lonesome place death,
 Despite the rage of foes.
 
[V4]
 O, brighter than that glorious morn
 Shall dawn upon our race
 They day when Christ in splendour comes,
 And we shall see His face.
 
[V5]
 The King shall come when morning dawns
 And light and beauty brings.
 Hail, Christ the Lord! Your people pray:
 Come quickly, King of kings.</lyrics>
