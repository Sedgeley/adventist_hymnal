    <lyrics>[V1]
 When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
 when sorrows like sea billows roll;
 whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
 It is well, it is well with my soul.
 
[C]
 It is well with my soul,
 it is well, it is well with my soul.
 
[V2]
 My sin–oh, the joy of this glorious thought–
 My sin, not in part but the whole,
 is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
 praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
 
[V3]
 And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
 the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
 the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
 even so, it is well with my soul.</lyrics>
