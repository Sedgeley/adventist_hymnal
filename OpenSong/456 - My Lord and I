    <lyrics>[V1]
 I have a Friend so precious,
 So very dear to me,
 He loves me with such tender love,
 He loves so faithfully;
 I could not live apart form Him,
 I love to feel Him nigh,
 And so we dwell together,
 My Lord and I.
 
[V2]
 Sometimes Iâ€™m faint and weary,
 He knows that I am weak,
 And as He bids me lean on Him,
 His help I gladly seek;
 He leads me in the paths of light,
 Beneath a sunny sky,
 And so we walk together,
 My Lord and I.
 
[V3]
 I tell Him all my sorrows,
 I tell Him all my joys,
 I tell Him all that pleases me,
 I tell Him what annoys;
 He tells me what I ought to do,
 He tells me how to try,
 And so we talk together,
 My Lord and I.
 
[V4]
 He knows that I am longing
 Some weary soul to win,
 And so He bids me go and speak
 The loving word for Him;
 He bids me tell His wondrous love,
 And why He came to die,
 And so we work together,
 My Lord and I.</lyrics>
