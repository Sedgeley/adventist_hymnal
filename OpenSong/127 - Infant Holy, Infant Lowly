    <lyrics>[V1]
 Infant holy, infant lowly,
 For His bed a cattle stall;
 Oxen lowing, little knowing
 Christ the babe is Lord of all;
 Swift are winging angels singing,
 Noels ringing, tidings bringing,
 Christ the babe is Lord of all,
 Christ the babe is Lord of all.
 
[V2]
 Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping
 Vigil till the morning new;
 Saw the glory, heard the story,
 Tidings of the gospel true;
 Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow,
 Praises voicing greet the morrow,
 Christ the babe was born for you,
 Christ the babe was born for you.</lyrics>
