    <lyrics>[V1]
 Faith of our fathers, living still,
 In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
 O how our hearts beat high with joy
 Whenever we hear that glorious Word!
 Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
 We will be true to thee till death.
 
[V2]
 Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
 Were still in heart and conscience free:
 How sweet would be their childrenâ€™s fate.
 If they, like them, could die for thee!
 Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
 We will be true to thee till death.
 
[V3]
 Faith of our fathers, we will love
 Both friend and foe in all our strife;
 And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
 By kindly words and virtuous life.
 Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
 We will be true to thee till death.</lyrics>
