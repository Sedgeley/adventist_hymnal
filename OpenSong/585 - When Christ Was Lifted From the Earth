    <lyrics>[V1]
 When Christ was lifted from the earth
 His arms stretched out above
 Through every culture, every birth,
 to draw an answering love.
 
[V2]
 Still east and west His love extends
 and always, near or far,
 He calls and claims us as His friends
 and loves us as we are.
 
[V3]
 Where generation, class, or race
 divides us to our shame,
 He sees not labels but a face,
 a person and a name.
 
[V4]
 Thus freely loved, thoâ€™ fully known,
 may I in Christ be free
 To welcome and accept His own
 as Christ accepted me.</lyrics>
