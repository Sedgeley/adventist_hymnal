    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord of all being, throned afar,
 Thy glory flames from sun and star;
 Center and soul of every sphere
 Yet to each loving heart how near!
 Yet to each loving heart how near!
 
[V2]
 Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray
 Shed on our path the glow of day;
 Star of our hope, Thy softened light
 Cheers the long watches of the night,
 Cheers the long watches of the night.
 
[V3]
 Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;
 Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;
 Our rainbow arch, Thy mercyâ€™s sign;
 All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine,
 All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.
 
[V4]
 Lord of all life, below, above
 Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,
 Before Thy ever-blazing throne
 We ask no luster of our own,
 We ask no luster of our own.
 
[V5]
 Grant us Thy truth to make us free
 And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;
 Till all Thy living altars claim
 One holy light, one heavenly flame!
 One holy light, one heavenly flame.</lyrics>
