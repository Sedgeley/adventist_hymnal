    <lyrics>[V1]
 Were you there when
 they crucified my Lord?
 Were you there when
 they crucified my Lord?
 O! Sometimes it causes me
 to tremble, tremble, tremble.
 Were you there when
 they crucified my Lord?
 
[V2]
 Were you there when
 they nailed Him to the tree?
 Were you there when
 they nailed Him to the tree?
 O! Sometimes it causes me
 to tremble, tremble, tremble.
 Were you there when
 they nailed Him to the tree?
 
[V3]
 Were you there when
 they pierced Him in the side?
 Were you there when
 they pierced Him in the side?
 O! Sometimes it causes me
 to tremble, tremble, tremble.
 Were you there when
 they pierced Him in the side?
 
[V4]
 Were you there when
 the sun refused to shine?
 Were you there when
 the sun refused to shine?
 O! Sometimes it causes me
 to tremble, tremble, tremble.
 Were you there when
 the sun refused to shine?
 
[V5]
 Were you there when
 they laid Him in the tomb?
 Were you there when
 they laid Him in the tomb?
 O! Sometimes it causes me
 to tremble, tremble, tremble.
 Were you there when
 they laid Him in the tomb?</lyrics>
