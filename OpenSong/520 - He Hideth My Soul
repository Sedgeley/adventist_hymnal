    <lyrics>[V1]
 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
 A wonderful Savior to me,
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
 Where rivers of pleasure I see.
 
[C]
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
 That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
 he hideth my life in the depths of His love,
 And covers me there with His hand,
 And covers me there with His hand.
 
[V2]
 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
 He taketh my burden away,
 He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
 He giveth me strength as my day.
 
[V3]
 With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
 And filled with His fullness divine,
 I sing in my rapture, Oh, Glory to God
 For such a Redeemer as mine.
 
[V4]
 When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
 To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
 His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
 Iâ€™ll shout with the millions on high.</lyrics>
