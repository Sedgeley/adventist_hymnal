    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, keep me near the cross;
 there a precious fountain,
 free to all, a healing stream,
 flows from Calvary’s mountain.
 
[C]
 In the cross, in the cross,
 be my glory ever,
 till my raptured soul shall find
 rest beyond the river.
 
[V2]
 Near the cross, a trembling soul,
 love and mercy found me;
 there the bright and morning star
 sheds its beams around me.
 
[V3]
 Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
 bring its scenes before me;
 help me walk from day to day
 with its shadow o’er me.
 
[V4]
 Near the cross I’ll watch and wait,
 hoping, trusting ever,
 till I reach the golden strand</lyrics>
