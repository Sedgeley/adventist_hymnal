    <lyrics>[V1]
 And have the bright immensities
 Received our risen Lord,
 Where light years frame the Pleiades
 And point Orion’s sword?
 Do flaming suns His footsteps trace
 Thro’corridors sublime,
 The Lord of inter stellar space
 And conqueror of time?
 
[V2]
 The heav’n that hides Him from our sight
 Knows neither near nor far;
 A little candle sheds its light
 As surely as a star.
 And where His loving people meet
 To share the gift divine,
 There stands He with unhurrying feet;
 There heav’nly splendors shine.</lyrics>
