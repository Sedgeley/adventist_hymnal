    <lyrics>[V1]
 O Jesus, I have promised
 to serve thee to the end;
 be thou forever near me,
 my Master and my friend.
 I shall not fear the battle
 if thou art by my side,
 nor wander from the pathway
 if thou wilt be my guide.
 
[V2]
 O let me feel thee near me!
 The world is ever near;
 I see the sights that dazzle,
 the tempting sounds I hear;
 my foes are ever near me,
 around me and within;
 but Jesus, draw thou nearer,
 and shield my soul from sin.
 
[V3]
 O Jesus, thou hast promised
 to all who follow thee
 that where thou art in glory
 there shall thy servant be.
 And Jesus, I have promised
 to serve thee to the end;
 O give me grace to follow,
 my Master and my Friend.</lyrics>
