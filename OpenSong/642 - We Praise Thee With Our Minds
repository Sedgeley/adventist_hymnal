    <lyrics>[V1]
 We praise Thee with our minds,
 O LordKept sharp think Thy thought;Come,
 Holy Ghost with grace outpoured,
 To teach what Christ hath taught.
 In all our learning may we seekThat wisdom from above
 Which comes to all: the brave,
 the meekWho ask in faith and love.
 
[V2]
 We praise Thee thro’ our bodies,
 Lord,Kept strong to do Thy will;
 Thy Spirit’s temples, which afford
 A means to praise Thee still.
 We give ourselves, a sacrifice,
 To live as unto Thee;
 For Thou alone hast paid the priceTo bring salvation free.
 
[V3]
 We praise Thee in our hearts,
 O king,Kept pure to know Thy ways;
 And raise to Thee a hymn to sing
 Eternally Thy praise.
 Altho adoring hearts will bow
 As age on ages roll;
 We praise Thee in our beings now,
 Mind, body, heart, and soul.</lyrics>
