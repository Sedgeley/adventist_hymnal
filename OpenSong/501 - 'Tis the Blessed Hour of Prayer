    <lyrics>[V1]
 ‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
 And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;
 If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
 
[C]
 What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
 Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of prayer,
 What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
 
[V2]
 ‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,
 With a tender compassion His children to hear;
 When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,
 
[V3]
 ‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
 To the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;
 With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;
 
[V4]
 ‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe,
 That the blessings we’re needing we’ll surely receive;
 In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;</lyrics>
