    <lyrics>[V1]
 There is singing up in heaven
 such as we have never known,
 Where the angels sing the praises
 of the Lamb upon the throne;
 Their sweet harps are ever tuneful
 and their voices are always clear,
 O that we might be more like them
 while we serve the Master here!
 
[C]
 Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
 And I expect to help them make
 the courts of heaven ring;
 But when I sing redemption’s story,
 they will fold their wings,
 For angels never felt the joys
 that our salvation brings.
 
[V2]
 But I hear another anthem,
 blending voices clear and strong,
 “Unto Him who hath redeemed us
 and hath bought us,” is the song;
 We have come thro’ tribulations
 to this land so fair and bright,
 In the fountain freely flowing
 He hath made our garments white.
 
[V3]
 Then the angels stand and listen,
 for they cannot join that song,
 Like the sound of many waters,
 by that happy, blood-washed throng;
 For they sing about great trials,
 battles fought and vict’ries won,
 And they praised the great Redeemer,
 who hath said to them, “Well done.”
 
[V4]
 So, although I’m not an angel,
 yet I know that over there
 I will join a blessed chorus
 that the angels cannot share;
 I will sing about my Savior,
 who upon dark Calvary
 Freely pardoned my transgressions,
 died to set the sinner free.</lyrics>
