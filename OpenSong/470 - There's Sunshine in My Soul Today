    <lyrics>[V1]
 There’s sunshine in my soul today,
 More glorious and bright
 Than glows in any earthly sky,
 For Jesus is my light.
 
[C]
 O there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine,
 When the peaceful, happy moments roll
 When Jesus shows His smiling face
 There is sunshine in the soul.
 
[V2]
 There’s music in my soul today,
 A carol to my King,
 And Jesus, listening, can hear
 The songs I cannot sing.
 
[V3]
 There’s springtime in my soul today,
 For when the Lord is near,
 The dove of peace sings in my heart,
 The flowers of grace appear.
 
[V4]
 Theres gladness in my soul today,
 And hope, and praise, and love,
 For blessings which He gives me now,
 For joys “laid up” above.</lyrics>
