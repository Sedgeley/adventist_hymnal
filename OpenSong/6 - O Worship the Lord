    <lyrics>[V1]
 O worship the Lord
 in the beauty of holiness,
 Bow down before Him,
 His glory proclaim;
 With gold of obedience,
 and incense of lowliness,
 Kneel and adore Him:
 the Lord is His name.
 
[V2]
 Low at His feet
 lay thy burden of carefulness,
 High on His heart
 He will bear it for thee,
 Comfort thy sorrows,
 and answer thy prayerfulness,
 Guiding thy steps
 as may best for thee be.
 
[V3]
 Fear not to enter
 His courts in the slenderness
 Of the poor wealth
 thou wouldst reckon as thine;
 Truth in its beauty,
 and love in its tenderness,
 These are the offerings
 to lay on His shrine.
 
[V4]
 These, though we bring them
 in trembling and fearfulness,
 He will accept
 for the name that is dear;
 Mornings of joy give
 for evenings of tearfulness,
 Trust for our trembling,
 and hope for our fear.</lyrics>
