    <lyrics>[V1]
 God is working His purpose out
 As year succeeds to year;
 God is working His purpose out,
 And the time is drawing near;
 Nearer and nearer draws the time,
 The time that shall surely be
 When the earth shall be filled
 with the glory of God
 As the waters cover the sea.
 
[V2]
 From utmost east to utmost west,
 Where’er man’s foot hath trod,
 By the mouth of many messengers
 Goes forth the voice of God;
 Give ear to me, ye continents,
 Ye isles, give ear to me,
 That the earth shall be filled
 with the glory of God
 As the waters cover the sea.
 
[V3]
 March we forth in the strength of God
 With the banner of Christ unfurled,
 That the light of the glorious gospel of truth
 May shine throughout the world:
 Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin
 To set their captives free,
 That the earth shall be filled
 with the glory of God
 As the waters cover the sea.
 
[V4]
 All we can do is nothing worth
 Unless God blesses the deed;
 Vainly we hope for the harvest tide
 Till God gives life to the seed;
 Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,
 The time that shall surely be,
 When the earth shall be filled
 with the glory of God
 As the waters cover the sea.</lyrics>
