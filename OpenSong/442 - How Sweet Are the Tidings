    <lyrics>[V1]
 How sweet are the tidings
 that greet the pilgrim’s ear,
 As he wanders in exile from home!
 Soon, soon will the Savior
 in glory appear,
 And soon will the kingdom come.
 
[C]
 He’s coming, coming, coming soon I know,
 Coming back to this earth again;
 And the weary pilgrims will to glory go,
 When the Savior comes to reign.
 
[V2]
 The mossy old graves
 where the pilgrims sleep
 Shall be open as wide as before,
 And the millions that sleep
 in the mighty deep
 Shall live on this earth once more.
 
[V3]
 There we’ll meet ne’er
 to part in our happy
 Eden home, Sweet songs
 of redemption we’ll sing;
 From the north, from the south,
 all the ransomed shall come,
 And worship our heavenly King.
 
[V4]
 Hallelujah, Amen!
 Hallelujah again!
 Soon, if faithful,
 we all shall be there;
 O, be watchful, be hopeful,
 be joyful till then, And a crown
 of bright glory we’ll wear.</lyrics>
