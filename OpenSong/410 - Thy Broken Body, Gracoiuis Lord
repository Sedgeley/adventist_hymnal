    <lyrics>[V1]
 Thy broken body, gracious Lord,
 Is shadowed by this broken bread;
 The wine which in this cup is poured,
 Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.
 
[V2]
 And while we meet together thus,
 We show that we are one in Thee;
 Thy precious blood was shed for us,
 Thy death, O Lord, hast set us free!
 
[V3]
 We have one hope that Thou wilt come,
 Thee in the air we wait to see;
 When Thou wilt give Thy saints a home,
 And we shall ever reign with Thee.</lyrics>
