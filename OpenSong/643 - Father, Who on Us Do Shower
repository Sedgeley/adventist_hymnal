    <lyrics>[V1]
 Father, who on us do shower
 Gifts of plenty form Your dower,
 To Your people give the power
 All Your gifts to use aright.
 
[V2]
 Give pure happiness in leisure
 Temperance in every pleasure,
 Wholesome use of earthly treasure
 Bodies clean and spirits bright.
 
[V3]
 Lift from this and every nation
 All that brings us degradation;
 Quell the forces of temptation;
 Put Your enemies to flight.
 
[V4]
 Father, You who sought and found us,
 Son of God, whose love has bound us,
 Holy Spirit, in us, round us,
 Hear us, Godhead infinite.</lyrics>
