    <lyrics>[V1]
 My Father is omnipotent
 And that you can’t deny;
 A God of might and miracles;
 ‘Tis written in the sky.
 
[C]
 It took a miracle to put the stars in place;
 It took a miracle to hang the world in space.
 But when He saved my soul,
 Cleansed and made me whole,
 It took a miracle of love and grace!
 
[V2]
 Though here His glory has been shown,
 We still can’t fully see
 The wonders of His might, His throne;
 ‘Till eternity.
 
[V3]
 The Bible tells us of His power
 And wisdom all way through;
 And every little bird and flower
 Are testimonies, too.</lyrics>
