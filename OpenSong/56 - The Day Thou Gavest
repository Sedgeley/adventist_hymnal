    <lyrics>[V1]
 The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended;
 the darkness falls at Thy behest;
 to Thee our morning hymns ascended;
 Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.
 
[V2]
 We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping
 while earth rolls onward into light,
 through all the world her watch is keeping,
 and rests not now by day or night.
 
[V3]
 As o’er each continent and island
 the dawn leads on another day,
 the voice of prayer is never silent,
 nor die the strains of praise away.
 
[V4]
 So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,
 like earth’s proud empires, pass away.
 Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever,
 till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.</lyrics>
