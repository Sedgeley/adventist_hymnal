    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear
 My voice ascending high;
 To Thee will I direct my prayer,
 To Thee lift up mine eye-
 
[V2]
 Up to the hills where Christ is gone
 To plead for all His saints,
 Presenting at His Fatherâ€™s throne
 Our songs and our complaints.
 
[V3]
 O may Thy Spirit guide my feet
 In ways of righteousness;
 Make every path of duty straight
 And plain before my face.
 4 The men that love and fear Thy name
 Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
 The mighty God will compass them
 With favor as a shield.</lyrics>
