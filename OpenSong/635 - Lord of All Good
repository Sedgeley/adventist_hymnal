    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord of all good, our gifts we bring You now;
 Use them Your holy purpose to fulfill.
 Tokens of love and pledges they shall be
 That our whole life is offered to Your will.
 
[V2]
 We give our minds to understand Your ways;
 Hands, voices, eyes to serve Your great design;
 Hearts with the flame of your own love ablaze:
 Thus for Your glory all our powâ€™rs combine.
 
[V3]
 Father, whose bounty all creation shows;
 Christ, by whose willing sacrifice we live;
 Spirit, from whom all life in fullness flows:
 To You with grateful hearts ourselves we give.</lyrics>
