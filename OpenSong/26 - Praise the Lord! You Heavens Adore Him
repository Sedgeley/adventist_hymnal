    <lyrics>[V1]
 Praise the Lord! you heavens, adore Him;
 Praise Him, angels in the height;
 Sun and moon, rejoice before Him,
 Praise Him, all you stars of light.
 Praise the Lord, for He has spoken;
 World His mighty voice obeyed;
 Laws which never shall be broken
 For their guidance He has made.
 
[V2]
 Praise the Lord! for He is glorious;
 Never shall HIs promise fail.
 God has made His saints victorious;
 Sin and death shall not prevail.
 Praise the God of our salvation!
 Hosts on high, His power proclaim;
 Heaven and earth and all creation,
 Laud and magnify His name.
 
[V3]
 Worship, honor, glory, blessing,
 Lord, we offer as our gift.
 Young and old, Your praise expressing,
 Our glad songs to You we lift.
 All the saints in heaven adore You,
 We would join their glad acclaim;
 As Your angels serve before You,
 So on earth we praise Your name.</lyrics>
