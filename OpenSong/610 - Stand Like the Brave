    <lyrics>[V1]
 O Christian, awake! ’tis the Master’s command;
 With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,
 To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,
 Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
 
[C]
 Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,
 Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
 
[V2]
 The cause of thy Master with vigor defend;
 Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end;
 Wherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go,
 Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
 
[V3]
 Press on, never doubting, thy Captain is near,
 With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer;
 His love, like a stream in the desert will flow;
 Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.</lyrics>
