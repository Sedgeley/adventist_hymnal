    <lyrics>[V1]
 Once our blessed Christ of beauty
 Was veiled off from human views;
 But through suffering, death, and sorrow
 He has rent the veil in two.
 
[C]
 O behold the Man of Sorrows!
 O behold Him in plain view!
 Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
 Since her rent the veil in two;
 Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
 Since her rent the veil in two.
 
[V2]
 Yes, He is with God, the Father,
 Interceding there for you;
 For He is the Well beloved
 Since He rent the veil in two.
 
[V3]
 Holy angels bow before Him,
 Men of earth give praises due;
 For He is the mighty Conqueror
 Since He rent the veil in two.</lyrics>
