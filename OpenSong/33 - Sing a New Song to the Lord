    <lyrics>[V1]
 Sing a new song to the Lord,
 He to whom wonders belong.
 Rejoice in His triumph and tell of His power.
 O sing a new song to the Lord.
 
[V2]
 Now to the ends of the earth
 See His salvation is shown.
 And still He remembers His mercy and truth,
 Unchanging in love to His own.
 
[V3]
 Sing a new song and rejoice.
 Publish His praises abroad.
 Let voices in chorus with trumpet and horn,
 Resound for the joy of the Lord.
 
[V4]
 Join with the hills and the sea,
 Thunders of praise to prolong.
 In judgement and justice
 He comes to the earth
 O sing a new song to the Lord.</lyrics>
