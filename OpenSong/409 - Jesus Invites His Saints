    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus invites His saints
 To meet around His board,
 And sup in memory of the death
 And sufferings of their Lord.
 
[V2]
 We take the bread and wine
 As emblems of Thy death;
 Lord, raise our souls above the sign,
 To feast on Thee by faith.
 
[V2]
 Faith eats the bread of life,
 And drinks the living wine;
 It looks beyond this scene of strife
 Unites us to the Vine.
 
[V4]
 Soon shall the night be gone,
 Our Lord will come again;
 The marriage supper of the Lamb
 Will usher in His reign.</lyrics>
