    <lyrics>[V1]
 All praise to thee, my God, this night,
 for all the blessings of the light!
 Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
 beneath thine own almighty wings.
 
[V2]
 Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son,
 the ill that I this day have done,
 that with the world, myself, and thee,
 I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.
 
[V3]
 O may my soul on thee repose,
 and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close,
 sleep that may me more vigorous make
 to serve my God when I awake.
 
[V4]
 Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
 praise him, all creatures here below;
 praise him above, ye heavenly host;
 praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</lyrics>
