    <lyrics>[V1]
 ‘Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
 and to take him at his word;
 just to rest upon his promise,
 and to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”
 
[C]
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
 How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
 O for grace to trust him more!
 
[V2]
 O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
 just to trust his cleansing blood;
 and in simple faith to plunge me
 neath the healing, cleansing flood!
 
[V3]
 Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
 just from sin and self to cease;
 just from Jesus simply taking
 life and rest, and joy and peace.
 
[V4]
 I’m so glad I learned to trust thee,
 precious Jesus, Savior, friend;
 and I know that thou art with me,
 wilt be with me to the end.</lyrics>
