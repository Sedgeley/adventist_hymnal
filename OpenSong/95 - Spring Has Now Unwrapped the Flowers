    <lyrics>[V1]
 Spring has now unwrapped the flowers,
 Day is fast reviving,
 Life in all her growing powers
 Towards the light is striving:
 Gone the iron touch of cold,
 Winter time and frost time,
 Seedlings, working through the mould,
 Now make up for lost time.
 
[V2]
 Herb and plant that winter long,
 Slumbered at their leisurek,
 Now be stirring, green and strong,
 Find in growth their pleasure:
 All the world with beauty fills,
 Gold the green enhacing;
 Flowers make glee among the hills,
 Set the meadows dancing.
 
[V3]
 Through each wonder of fair days
 God Himself expresses;
 Beauty follows all His ways,
 As the world He blesses:
 So, as He renews the earth,
 Artist without rival,
 In His grace of glad new birth
 We must seek revival.</lyrics>
