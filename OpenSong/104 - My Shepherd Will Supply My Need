    <lyrics>[V1]
 My Shepherd will supply my need,
 Jehovah is His name.
 In pastures fresh He makes me feed
 Beside the living stream.
 He brings my wand’ring spirit back
 When I forsake His ways,
 And leads, me for His mercy’s sake,
 In paths of truth and grace.
 
[V2]
 When I walk through the shades of death,
 Thy presence is my stay;
 A word of Thy supporting breath
 Drives all my fears away.
 Thy hand in sight of all my foes
 Doth still my table spread;
 My cup with blessings overflows,
 Thine oil anoints my head.
 
[V3]
 The sure provisions of my God
 Attend me all my days;
 O may Thy house be mine abode
 And all my work be praise.
 There would I find a settled rest
 While others go and come;
 No more a stranger or a guest,
 But like a child at home.</lyrics>
