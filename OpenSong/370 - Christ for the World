    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christ for the world we sing,
 the world to Christ we bring,
 with loving zeal;
 the poor, and them that mourn,
 the faint and overborne,
 sinsick and sorrow-worn,
 whom Christ doth heal.
 
[V2]
 Christ for the world we sing,
 the world to Christ we bring,
 with fervent prayer;
 the wayward and the lost,
 by restless passions tossed,
 redeemed at countless cost,
 from dark despair.
 
[V3]
 Christ for the world we sing,
 the world to Christ we bring,
 with joyful song;
 the newborn souls, whose days,
 reclaimed from errorâ€™s ways,
 inspired with hope and praise,
 to Christ belong.</lyrics>
