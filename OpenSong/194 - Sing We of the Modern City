    <lyrics>[V1]
 Sing we of the modern city,
 Scene alike of joy and stress;
 Sing we of its nameless people
 In their urban wilderness.
 Into endless rows of houses
 Life is set a millionfold,
 Life expressed in human beings
 Daily born and growing old.
 
[V2]
 In the city full of people,
 World of speed and hectic days,
 In the ever-changing setting
 Of the latest trend and craze,
 Christ is present, and among us;
 In the crowd we see Him stand.
 In the bustle of the city
 Jesus Christ is every man.
 
[V3]
 God is not remote in heaven,
 But on earth to share our shame,
 Changing graph and mass and number
 Into persons with a name.
 Christ has shown, beyond statistics,
 Human life with glory crowned,
 By His timeless presence proving
 People matter, people count!</lyrics>
