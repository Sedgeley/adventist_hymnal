    <lyrics>[V1]
 Spirit divine, attend our prayers,
 And make this house Thy home;
 Descend with all Thy gracious powers,
 O come, great Spirit, come!
 
[V2]
 Come as the light; to us reveal
 Our emptiness and woe,
 And lead us in those paths of life
 Where-on the righteous go.
 
[V3]
 Come as the fire, and purge our hearts
 Like sacrificial flame;
 Let our whole soul an of – f’ring be
 To our Redeemer’s name.
 
[V4]
 Come as the dove, and spread Thy wings,
 The wings of peaceful love;
 And let Thy church on earth become
 Blest as the church above.
 
[V5]
 Spirit divine, attend our prayers,
 Make a lost world Thy home;
 Descend with all Thy gracious powers,
 O come, great Spirit, come!</lyrics>
