    <lyrics>[V1]
 Soldiers of Christ,arise,
 And put your armor on,
 Strong in the strength which God supplies
 Through His eternal Son
 Strong in the Lord of hosts,
 And in His mighty power,
 Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
 Is more than conqueror.
 
[V2]
 Stand then in His great might,
 With all His strength endued,
 But take, to arm you for the fight,
 The panoply of God;
 That, having all things done,
 And all your conflicts passed,
 Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,
 And stand entire at last.
 
[V3]
 From strength to strength go on,
 Wrestle and fight and pray,
 Tread all the powers of darkness down
 And win the well-fought day.
 Still let the Spirit cry
 In all His soldiers, “Come!”
 Till Christ the Lord who reigns on high
 Shall take the conquerors home.</lyrics>
