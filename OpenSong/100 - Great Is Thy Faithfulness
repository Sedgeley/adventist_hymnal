    <lyrics>[V1]
 Great is Thy faithfulness,
 O God my Father;
 There is no shadow
 of turning with Thee;
 Thou changest not,
 Thy compassions, they fail not;
 As Thou hast been,
 Thou forever will be.
 
[C]
 Great is Thy faithfulness!
 Great is Thy faithfulness!
 Morning by morning
 new mercies I see.
 All I have needed
 Thy hand hath provided;
 Great is Thy faithfulness,
 Lord, unto me!
 
[V2]
 Summer and winter and
 springtime and harvest,
 Sun, moon and stars
 in their courses above
 Join with all nature
 in manifold witness
 To Thy great faithfulness,
 mercy and love.
 
[V3]
 Pardon for sin and
 a peace that endureth
 Thine own dear presence
 to cheer and to guide;
 Strength for today and
 bright hope for tomorrow,
 Blessings all mine,
 with ten thousand beside!</lyrics>
