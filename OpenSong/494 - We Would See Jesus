    <lyrics>[V1]
 “We would see Jesus;” for the shadows lengthen
 Across the little landscape of our life;
 We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
 For the last conflict, in this mortal strife.
 
[V2]
 “We would see Jesus,” Rock of our salvation,
 Where on our feet were set with sovereign grace;
 Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,
 Can thence remove us, gazing on His face.
 
[V3]
 “We would see Jesus;” other lights are paling,
 Which for long years we did rejoice to see;
 The blessings of this sinful world are failing;
 We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.
 
[V4]
 “We would see Jesus;” this is all we’re needing-
 Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight;
 We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,
 Soon to return and end this mortal night!</lyrics>
