    <lyrics>[V1]
 There’s a song in the air!
 There’s a star in the sky!
 There’s a mother’s deep prayer
 And a baby’s low cry!
 And the star rains its fire
 while the beautiful sing,
 For the manger of Bethlehem
 cradles a King!
 
[V2]
 There’s a tumult of joy
 O’er the wonderful birth,
 For the virgin’s sweet boy
 Is the Lord of the earth.
 Aye! the star rains its fire
 while the beautiful sing,
 For the manger of Bethlehem
 cradles a King!
 
[V3]
 In the light of that star
 Lie the ages impearled;
 And that song from afar
 Has swept over the world.
 Every hearth is aflame
 and the beautiful sing
 In the homes of the nations
 that Jesus is King!
 
[V4]
 We rejoice in the light,
 And we echo the song
 That comes down through the night
 From the heavenly throng.
 Aye! we shout to
 the lovely evangel they bring,
 And we greet in His cradle
 our Savior and King!</lyrics>
