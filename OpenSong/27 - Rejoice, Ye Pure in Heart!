    <lyrics>[V1]
 Rejoice ye pure in heart!
 Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;
 Your festal banner wave on high,
 The cross of Christ your King.
 
[C]
 Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice,
 Give thanks and sing.
 
[V2]
 With voice as full and strong
 As ocean’s surging praise,
 Send forth the sturdy hymns of old,
 The psalms of ancient days.
 
[V3]
 With all the angel choirs,
 With all the saints of earth,
 Pour out the strains of joy and bliss,
 True rapture, noblest mirth.
 
[V4]
 Yes, on through life’s long path,
 Still chanting as ye go;
 From youth to age, by night and day,
 In gladness and in woe.
 
[V5]
 Praise Him who reigns on high,
 The Lord whom we adore,
 The Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
 One God forever more.</lyrics>
