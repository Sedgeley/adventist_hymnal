    <lyrics>[V1]
 May God be with you Till we meet again,
 May God be with you, Keep you safe till then;
 And may His blessings Be within your heart,
 May God be with you While weâ€™re apart,
 May God be with you.
 
[V2]
 May God be with you, Watch you from above,
 May God protect you in His tender love;
 And with the dawning Of each bright, new day,
 May God be with you, To guide your way,
 May God be with you.</lyrics>
