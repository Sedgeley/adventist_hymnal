    <lyrics>[V1]
 I will sing of my Redeemer,
 And His wondrous love to me;
 On the cruel cross He suffered,
 From the curse to set me free.
 
[C]
 Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
 With His blood, He purchased me.
 On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
 Paid the debt, and made me free.
 
[V2]
 I will tell the wondrous story,
 How my lost estate to save,
 In His boundless love and mercy,
 He the ransom freely gave.
 
[V3]
 I will sing of my Redeemer,
 And His heavenly love to me;
 He from death to life hath brought me,
 Son of God with Him to be.</lyrics>
