    <lyrics>[V1]
 Now thank we all our God
 with heart and hands and voices,
 who wondrous things hath done,
 in whom His world rejoices;
 Who, from our mothersâ€™ arms
 hath blessed us on our way
 with countless gifts of love,
 and still is ours today.
 
[V2]
 O may this bounteous God
 through all our life be near us,
 with ever joyful hearts
 and blessed peace to cheer us;
 and keep us still in grace,
 and guide us when perplexed;
 and free us from all ills,
 in this world and the next.
 
[V3]
 All praise and thanks to God
 the Father now be given;
 the Son, and Him who reigns
 with them in highest heaven;
 the one eternal God,
 whom earth and heaven adore;
 for thus it was, is now,
 and shall be evermore.</lyrics>
