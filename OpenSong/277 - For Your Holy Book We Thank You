    <lyrics>[V1]
 For Your holy book we thank You,
 And for all who served You well,
 Writing, guarding, and translating,
 That its pages might forth tell
 Your strong love and tender care
 For Your people everywhere.
 
[V2]
 For Your holy book we thank You,
 And for those who work today,
 That the people of all nations,
 Reading it and following may
 Know Your love and tender care
 For Your people everywhere.
 
[V3]
 For Your holy book we thank You,
 May its message be our guide,
 May we understand the wisdom
 Of the laws it will provide:
 And Your love and tender care
 For Your people everywhere.
 
[V4]
 For Your holy book we thank You,
 May its message in our hearts
 Lead us now to see in Jesus
 All the grace Your word imparts:
 All Your love and tender care
 For Your people everywhere.</lyrics>
