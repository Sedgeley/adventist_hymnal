    <lyrics>[V1]
 Break thou the bread of life,
 dear Lord, to me,
 as thou didst break the loaves
 beside the sea;
 beyond the sacred page
 I seek thee, Lord;
 my spirit pants for thee,
 O Living Word!
 
[V2]
 Bless thou the truth,
 dear Lord, to me, to me,
 as thou didst bless
 the bread by Galilee;
 then shall all bondage cease,
 all fetters fall;
 and I shall find my peace,
 my all in all.
 
[V3]
 Thou art the bread of life,
 O Lord, to me;
 Thy holy Word the truth
 That saveth me;
 Give me to eat
 and live With Thee above;
 Teach me to love Thy truth,
 For Thou art love.
 
[V4]
 Spirit and life are they,
 Words Thou dost speak;
 I hasten to obey,
 But I am weak;
 Thou art my only help,
 Thou art my life;
 Heeding Thy holy Word
 I win the strife.</lyrics>
