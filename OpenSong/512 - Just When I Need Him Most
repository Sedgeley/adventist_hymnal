    <lyrics>[V1]
 Just when I need Him, Jesus is near,
 Just when I falter, just when I fear;
 Ready to help me, ready to cheer,
 Just when I need Him most.
 Just when I need Him most,
 Just when I need Him most,
 Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,
 Just when I need Him most.
 
[V2]
 Just when I need Him, Jesus is true,
 Never forsaking, all the way through,
 Giving for burdens pleasures anew,
 Just when I need Him most.
 Just when I need Him most,
 Just when I need Him most,
 Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,
 Just when I need Him most.
 
[V3]
 Just when I need Him, Jesus is strong,
 Bearing my burdens all the day long;
 For all my sorrow giving a song,
 Just when I need Him most.
 Just when I need Him most,
 Just when I need Him most,
 Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,
 Just when I need Him most.
 
[V4]
 Just when I need Him, He is my all,
 Answering when upon Him I call;
 Tenderly watching lest I should fall,
 Just when I need Him most.
 Just when I need Him most,
 Just when I need Him most,
 Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,
 Just when I need Him most.</lyrics>
