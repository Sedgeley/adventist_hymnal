    <lyrics>[V1]
 Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,
 Living with Jesus, a new life divine,
 Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
 
[C]
 Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
 Moment by moment I’ve life from above;
 Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
 
[V2]
 Never a trial that He is not there,
 Never a burden that He doth not bear,
 Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
 Moment by moment I’m under His care.
 
[V3]
 Never a heart-ache, and never a groan,
 Never a teardrop and never a moan;
 Never a danger but there on teh throne,
 Moment by moment He thinks of His own.
 
[V4]
 Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
 Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
 Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
 Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.</lyrics>
