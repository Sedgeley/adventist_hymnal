    <lyrics>[V1]
 Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
 thy better portion trace;
 Rise from transitory things
 toward heaven, thy native place;
 Sun, and moon, and stars decay;
 time shall soon this earth remove;
 Rise, my soul, and haste away
 to seats prepared above.
 
[V2]
 Rivers to the ocean run,
 nor stay in all their course;
 Fire ascending seeks the sun;
 both speed them to their source;
 So a soul thatâ€™s born of God,
 longs to view His glorious face,
 Forward tends to His abode
 to rest in His embrace.
 
[V3]
 Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn;
 press onward to the prize;
 Soon our Savior will return,
 triumphant in the skies;
 Yet a season, and you know
 happy entrance will be given,
 All our sorrows left below,
 and earth exchanged for heaven.</lyrics>
