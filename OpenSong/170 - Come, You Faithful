    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, you faithful, raise the strain
 Of triumphant gladness;
 God has brought His Israel
 Into joy from sadness;
 Loosed from Pharoah’s bitter yoke
 Jacob’s sons and daughters;
 Led them with unmoistened foot
 Through the Red Sea waters.
 
[V2]
 ‘Tis the spring of souls today;
 Christ has burst His prison,
 And from three days’sleep in death
 As a sun has risen;
 All the winter of our sins,
 Long and dark, is flying
 From His light, to whom is giv’n
 Laud and praise undying.
 
[V3]
 Now the queen of seasons, bright
 With the day of splendor,
 With the royal feast of feasts,
 Comes its joy to render;
 Comes to gladden faithful hearts
 Which with true affection
 Welcome in unwearied strain
 Jesus’resurrection.
 
[V4]
 For today among the twelve
 Christ appeared, be stowing
 His deep peace, which evermore
 Passes human knowing.
 Neither could the gates of death,
 Nor the tomb’s dark portal,
 Nor the watchers, nor the seal,
 Hold Him as a mortal.
 
[V5]
 “Alleluia!” now we cry
 To our King immortal,
 Who, triumphant, burst the bars
 Of the tomb’s dark portal;
 “Alleluia” with the Son,
 God the Father praising;
 “Alleluia!” yet again
 To the Spirit raising.</lyrics>
