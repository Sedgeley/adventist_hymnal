    <lyrics>[V1]
 I will early seek the Savior,
 I will learn of Him each day;
 I will follow in His footsteps,
 I will walk the narrow way.
 
[C]
 For He loves me, yes, He loves me,
 Jesus loves me, this I know.
 Jesus loves me, died to save me,
 This is why I love Him so.
 
[V2]
 I will hasten where He bids me,
 I am not too young to go
 In the pathway where He leadeth,
 Not too young His will to know.
 
[V3]
 He is standing at the doorway
 Of escape from every sin;
 I will knock, for He has promised,
 He will hear and let me in.</lyrics>
