    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord Jesus, I long
 to be perfectly whole;
 I want Thee forever
 to live in my soul;
 Break down every idol,
 cast out every foe;
 Now wash me, and I
 shall be whiter than snow.
 
[C]
 Whiter than snow,
 yes, whiter than snow;
 Now wash me, and I
 shall be whiter than snow.
 
[V2]
 Lord Jesus, look down
 from Thy throne in the skies,
 And help me to make
 a complete sacrifice;
 I give up myself,
 and whatever I know;
 Now wash me, and I
 shall be whiter than snow.
 
[V3]
 Lord Jesus, for this
 I most humbly entreat;
 I wait, blessed Lord,
 at Thy crucified feet,
 By faith, for my cleansing;
 I see Thy blood flow;
 Now wash me, and I
 shall be whiter than snow.
 
[V4]
 Lord Jesus, Thou seest
 I patiently wait;
 Come now, and within me
 a new heart create;
 To those who have sought Thee,
 Thou never saidâ€™st No;
 Now wash me, and I
 shall be whiter than snow.</lyrics>
