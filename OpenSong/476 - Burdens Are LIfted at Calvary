    <lyrics>[V1]
 Days are filled with sorrow and care,
 Hearts are lonely and drear;
 Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
 Jesus is very near.
 
[C]
 Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
 Calvary, Calvary,
 Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
 Jesus is very near.
 
[V2]
 Cast your care on Jesus today,
 Leave your worry and fear;
 Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
 Jesus is very near.
 
[V3]
 Troubled soul, the Saviour can see,
 Evâ€™ry heartache and tear;
 Burdens are lifted at Calvary
 Jesus is very near.</lyrics>
