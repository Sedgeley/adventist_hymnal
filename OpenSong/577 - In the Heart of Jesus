    <lyrics>[V1]
 In the heart of Jesus there is love for you,
 Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;
 Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,
 When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?
 
[V2]
 In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you,
 Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;
 Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,
 Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?
 
[V3]
 In the field of Jesus there is work for you;
 Such as even angels might rejoice to do;
 Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand,
 While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?
 
[V4]
 In the home of Jesus thereâ€™s a place for you;
 Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful too;
 Why then, like a wanderer, roam with weary pace,
 If the home of Jesus holds for you a place?</lyrics>
