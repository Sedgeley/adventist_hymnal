    <lyrics>[V1]
 
[C]
 Now is born the divine Christ child,
 Play the musette, play the tuneful oboe,
 Now is born the divine Christ child,
 Sing we all and rejoice this day.
 
[V1]
 He was born in a stable bare,
 On bed of straw how He sleeps so soundly,
 He was born in a stable bare,
 Let us worship and to Him bow.
 
[V2]
 Ages long since are past and gone,
 When the wise men foretold His coming,
 Ages long since are past and gone,
 When the wise men foretold His birth.</lyrics>
