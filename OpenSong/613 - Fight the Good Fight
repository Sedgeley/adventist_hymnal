    <lyrics>[V1]
 Fight the good fight with all thy might;
 Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;
 Lay hold on life and it shall be
 Thy joy and crown eternally.
 
[V2]
 Run the straight race through Godâ€™s good grace;
 Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face.
 Life with its path before us lies;
 Christ is the way, and Christ the prize.
 
[V3]
 Cast care aside, lean on thy guide,
 His boundless mercy will provide;
 Trust, and the trusting soul shall prove
 Christ is its life, and Christ its love.
 
[V4]
 Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near;
 He changeth not, and thou art dear.
 Only believe, and thou shalt see
 That Christ is all in all to thee.</lyrics>
