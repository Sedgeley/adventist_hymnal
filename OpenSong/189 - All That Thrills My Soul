    <lyrics>[V1]
 Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
 By His presence all divine?
 True and tender, pure and precious,
 Oh, how blest to call Him mine!
 
[C]
 All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
 He is more than life to me; (to me;)
 And the fairest of ten thousand,
 In my blessed Lord I see.
 
[V2]
 Love of Christ so freely given,
 Grace of God beyond degree,
 Mercy higher than the heaven,
 Deeper than the deepest sea.
 
[V3]
 Every need His hand supplying,
 Every good in Him I see;
 On His strength divine relying,
 He is All in All to me.
 
[V4]
 By the crystal flowing river
 With the ransomed I will sing,
 And forever and forever
 Praise and glorify the King.</lyrics>
