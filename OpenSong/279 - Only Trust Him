    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, every soul by sin oppressed,
 Thereâ€™s mercy with the Lord,
 And He will surely give you rest,
 By trusting in His word.
 
[C]
 Only trust Him, only trust Him,
 Only trust Him now;
 He will save you, He will save you,
 He will save you now.
 
[V2]
 For Jesus shed his precious blood
 Rich blessings to bestow;
 Plunge now into the crimson flood
 That washes white as snow.
 
[V3]
 Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way,
 That leads you into rest;
 Believe in Him without delay,
 And you are fully blest.
 
[V4]
 Come, then, and join this holy band,
 And on to glory go,
 To dwell in that celestial land,
 Where joys immortal flow.</lyrics>
