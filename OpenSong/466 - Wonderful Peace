    <lyrics>[V1]
 Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight,
 Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
 In celestial like strains it unceasingly falls
 Oâ€™er my soul like an infinite calm.
 
[C]
 Peace! Peace! wonderful peace,
 Coming down from the Father above;
 Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,
 In fathomless billows of love.
 
[V2]
 What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,
 Buried deep in my inner most soul,
 So secure that no power can mine it away,
 While the years of eternity roll!
 
[V3]
 I believe when I rise to that city of peace,
 Where the Author of peace I shall see,
 That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing,
 In that heavenly kingdom will be-
 
[V4]
 Weary soul, without gladness or comfort or rest,
 Passing down the rough pathway of time!
 Make the Savior your friend ere the shadows grow dark;
 O accept of this peace so sublime.</lyrics>
