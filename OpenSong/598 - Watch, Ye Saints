    <lyrics>[V1]
 Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;
 Lo! The powers of heaven are shaking;
 Keep your lamps all trimmed an burning,
 Ready for your Lord’s returning.
 
[C]
 Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes;
 Lo! He come, He comes all glorious!
 Jesus comes to reign victorious,
 Lo! He comes, yes, Jesus comes.
 
[V2]
 Lo! the promise of your Savior,
 Pardoned sin and purchased favor,
 Blood-washed robes and crowns of glory;
 Haste to tell redemption’s story.
 
[V3]
 Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,
 Hark! His chariot wheels are rumbling;
 Tell, O tell of grace abounding,
 While the seventh trump is sounding.
 
[V4]
 Nations wane, though proud and stately;
 Christ His kingdom hasteneth greatly;
 Earth her latest pangs is summing;
 Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.
 
[V5]
 Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;
 Now for you He’s interceding;
 Haste, ere grace and time diminished
 Shall proclaim the mystery finished.</lyrics>
