    <lyrics>[V1]
 Marvelous grace of our loving Lord.
 Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!
 Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured
 There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.
 
[C]
 Grace, grace, God’s grace,
 Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
 Grace, grace, God’s grace,
 Grace that is greater than all our sin!
 
[V2]
 Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold,
 Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
 Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold
 Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.
 
[V3]
 Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
 Freely bestowed on all who believe!
 You that are longing to see His face,
 Will you this moment His grace receive?</lyrics>
