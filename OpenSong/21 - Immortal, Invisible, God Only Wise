    <lyrics>[V1]
 Immortal, invisible,
 God only wise,
 In light inaccessible
 hid from our eyes,
 Most blessed, most glorious,
 the Ancient of Days,
 Almighty, victorious,
 Thy great Name we praise.
 
[V2]
 Unresting, unhasting,
 and silent as light,
 Nor wanting, nor wasting,
 Thou rulest in might;
 Thy justice, like mountains,
 high soaring above
 Thy clouds, which are fountains
 of goodness and love.
 
[V3]
 To all, life Thou givest,
 to both great and small;
 In all life Thou livest,
 the true life of all;
 We blossom and flourish
 as leaves on the tree,
 And wither and perish
 but naught changeth Thee.
 
[V4]
 Great Father of glory,
 pure Father of light,
 Thine angels adore Thee,
 all veiling their sight;
 All praise we would render;
 O help us to see
 â€˜Tis only the splendor
 of light hideth Thee!</lyrics>
