    <lyrics>[V1]
 Praise the Lord, His glories show, Alleluia!
 Saints within His courts below, Alleluia!
 Angels â€™round His throne above, Alleluia!
 All that see and share His love, Alleluia!
 
[V2]
 Earth to heaven and heaven to earth, Alleluia!
 Tell His wonders, sing His worth, Alleluia!
 Age to age and shore to shore, Alleluia!
 Praise Him, praise Him evermore! Alleluia!
 
[V3]
 Praise the Lord, His mercies trace, Alleluia!
 Praise His providence and grace, Alleluia!
 All that He for man hath done, Alleluia!
 All He sends us through His Son. Alleluia!</lyrics>
