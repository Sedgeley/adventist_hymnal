    <lyrics>[V1]
 Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
 forgive our foolish ways;
 reclothe us in our rightful mind,
 in purer lives thy service find,
 in deeper reverence, praise.
 
[V2]
 In simple trust like theirs who heard,
 beside the Syrian sea,
 the gracious calling of the Lord,
 let us, like them, without a word,
 rise up and follow thee.
 
[V3]
 O sabbath rest by Galilee,
 O calm of hills above,
 where Jesus knelt to share with thee
 the silence of eternity,
 interpreted by love!
 
[V4]
 Drop thy still dews of quietness,
 till all our strivings cease;
 take from our souls the strain and stress,
 and let our ordered lives confess
 the beauty of thy peace.
 
[V5]
 Breathe through the heats of our desire
 thy coolness and thy balm;
 let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
 speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
 O still, small voice of calm.</lyrics>
