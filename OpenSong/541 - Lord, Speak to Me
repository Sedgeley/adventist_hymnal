    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
 in living echoes of thy tone;
 as thou has sought, so let me seek
 thine erring children lost and lone.
 
[V2]
 O lead me, Lord, that I may lead
 the wandering and the wavering feet;
 O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
 thy hungering ones with manna sweet.
 
[V3]
 O strengthen me, that while I stand
 firm on the rock, and strong in thee,
 I may stretch out a loving land
 to wrestlers with the troubled sea.</lyrics>
