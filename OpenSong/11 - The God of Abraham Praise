    <lyrics>[V1]
 The God of Abraham praise,
 Who reigns enthroned above;
 Ancient of everlasting days,
 And God of love;
 Jehovah! Great I AM!
 By earth and heaven confessed;
 I bow and bless the sacred name,
 Forever blest.
 
[V2]
 The God of Abraham praise,
 At whose supreme command
 From earth I rise, and seek the joys
 At His right hand;
 I all on earth forsake,
 Its wisdom, fame and power;
 And Him my only portion make,
 My shield and tower.
 
[V3]
 The whole triumphant host
 Give thanks to God on high;
 “Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!”
 They ever cry;
 Hail, Abraham’s God and mine!
 I join the heavenly lays;
 All might and majesty are Thine,
 And endless praise.</lyrics>
