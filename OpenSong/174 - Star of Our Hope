    <lyrics>[V1]
 Star of our hope! Heâ€™ll soon appear,
 The last loud trumpet speaks Him near;
 Hail Him, all saints, from pole to pole-
 How welcome to the faithful soul!
 
[V2]
 From heaven angelic voices sound:
 Behold the Lord of glory crowned,
 Arrayed in majesty divine,
 And in His highest glories shine.
 
[V3]
 The grave yields up its precious trust,
 Which long has slumbered in the dust,
 Resplendent forms ascending, fair,
 Now meet the Savior in the air.
 
[V4]
 Descending with His azure throne,
 He claims the kingdom for His own;
 The saints rejoice, they shout, they sing,
 And hail Him their triumphant King.</lyrics>
