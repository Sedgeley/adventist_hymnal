    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christ is made the sure foundation,
 Christ the head and cornerstone,
 chosen of the Lord, and precious,
 binding all the Church in one;
 holy Zionâ€™s help for ever,
 and her confidence alone.
 
[V2]
 All that dedicated city,
 dearly loved of God on high,
 in exultant jubilation
 pours perpetual melody;
 God the One in Three adoring
 in glad hymns eternally.
 
[V3]
 To this temple, where we call thee,
 come, O Lord of Hosts, today;
 with thy wonted loving-kindness
 hear thy servants as they pray,
 and thy fullest benediction
 shed within its walls alway.
 
[V4]
 Here vouchsafe to all thy servants
 what they ask of thee of gain;
 what they gain from thee, for ever
 with the blessed to retain,
 and hereafter in thy glory
 evermore with thee to reign.
 
[V5]
 Laud and honor to the Father,
 laud and honor to the Son,
 laud and honor to the Spirit,
 ever Three, and ever One,
 con-substantial, co-eternal,
 while unending ages run.</lyrics>
