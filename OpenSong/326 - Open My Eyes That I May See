    <lyrics>[V1]
 Open my eyes, that I may see
 Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
 Place in my hands the wonderful key
 That shall unclasp and set me free.
 Silently now I wait for Thee,
 Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
 Open my eyes,
 illumine me, Spirit Divine!
 
[V2]
 Open my ears that I may hear
 Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
 and while the wavenotes fall on my ear,
 Everything false will disappear.
 Silently now I wait for Thee,
 Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
 Open my ears, illumine me, Spirit Divine!
 
[V3]
 Open my mouth, and let me bear
 Gladly the warm truth everywhere;
 Open my heart, and let me prepare
 Love with Thy children thus to share.
 Silently now I wait for Thee,
 Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
 Open my heart, illumine me, Spirit Divine!</lyrics>
