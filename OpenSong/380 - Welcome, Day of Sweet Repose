    <lyrics>[V1]
 Welcome, day of sweet repose!
 Blessed be thy sacred hours!
 We would trust the One who knows
 All our weak and failing powers.
 
[V2]
 Welcome, day in Eden born!
 Holy rest for sinless man!
 Like the dawning of fair morn
 Come thy hours to us again.
 
[V3]
 Welcome, day blessed by our Lord!
 Toil shall cease and anxious care.
 Day commanded by His word,
 Day for song and praise and prayer.
 
[V4]
 Welcome, day our Savior kept!
 Keeping, wrought our righteousness,
 Day God bids us neâ€™er forget,
 Day of days His name to bless.</lyrics>
