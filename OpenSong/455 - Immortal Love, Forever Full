    <lyrics>[V1]
 Immortal Love, forever full,
 Forever flowing free,
 Forever shared, forever whole,
 A never ebbing sea!
 
[V2]
 We nay not climb the heavenly steeps
 To bring the Lord Christ down;
 In vain we search the lowest deeps,
 For him no depths can drown.
 
[V3]
 But warm, so tender, even yet
 A present help is He;
 And faith has still its Olivet,
 And love its Galilee.
 
[V4]
 The healing of His seamless dress
 Is by our beds of pain;
 We touch Him in life’s throng and press,
 And we are whole again.
 
[V5]
 Through Him the first fond prayers are said,
 Our lips of childhood frame;
 The last low whispers of our dead
 Are burdened with His name.
 
[V6]
 O Lord and Master of us all:
 Whate’er our names or sign,
 We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
 We test our lives by Thine!</lyrics>
