    <lyrics>[V1]
 Nothing between my soul and my Savior,
 naught of this world’s delusive dream;
 I have renounced all sinful pleasure;
 Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.
 
[C]
 Nothing between my soul and my Savior,
 so that his blessed face may be seen;
 nothing preventing the least of his favor;
 keep the way clear! let nothing between.
 
[V2]
 Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;
 habits of life, though harmless they seem,
 must not my heart from him ever sever;
 he is my all, there’s nothing between.
 
[V3]
 Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,
 though the whole world against me convene;
 watching with prayer and much self denial,
 I’ll triumph at last, there’s nothing between.</lyrics>
