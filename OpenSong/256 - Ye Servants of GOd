    <lyrics>[V1]
 Ye servants of God,
 your Master proclaim,
 and publish abroad
 his wonderful name;
 the name all-victorious
 of Jesus extol,
 his kingdom is glorious
 and rules over all.
 
[V2]
 God ruleth on high,
 almighty to save,
 and still he is nigh,
 his presence we have;
 the great congregation
 his triumph shall sing,
 ascribing salvation
 to Jesus, our King.
 
[V3]
 “Salvation to God,
 who sits on the throne!”
 Let all cry aloud
 and honor the Son;
 the praises of Jesus
 the angels proclaim,
 fall down on their faces
 and worship the Lamb.
 
[V4]
 Then let us adore
 and give him his right,
 all glory and power,
 all wisdom and might;
 all honor and blessing
 with angels above,
 and thanks never ceasing
 and infinite love.</lyrics>
