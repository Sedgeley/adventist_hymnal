    <lyrics>[V1]
 Make me a captive, Lord,
 and then I shall be free;
 Force me to render up my sword,
 and I shall conqueror be.
 I sink in life’s alarms
 when by myself I stand;
 Imprison me within Thine arms,
 and strong shall be my hand.
 
[V2]
 My heart is weak and poor
 until it amaster find;
 It has no spring of action sure,
 it varies with the wind.
 It cannot freely move till
 Thou has wrought its chain;
 Enslave it with Thy matchless love,
 and deathless it shall reign.
 
[V3]
 My will is not my own
 till Thou hast made it Thine;
 If it would reach a monarch’s throne,
 it must its crown resign;
 It only stands unbent,
 amid the clashing strife,
 When on Thy bosom it has leant,
 and found in Thee its life.</lyrics>
