    <lyrics>[V1]
 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
 “Come unto Me and rest;
 Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
 Thy head upon My breast.”
 I came to Jesus as I was,
 Weary and worn and sad;
 I found in Him a resting place,
 And He has made me glad.
 
[V2]
 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
 “Behold, I freely give
 The living water; thirsty one,
 Stoop down and drink and live.”
 I came to Jesus, and I drank
 Of that life giving stream;
 My thirst was quench’d, my soul revived,
 And now I live in Him.
 
[V3]
 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
 “I am this dark world’s light;
 Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
 And all thy day be bright.”
 I looked to Jesus, and I found
 In Him my star, my sun;
 And in that light of life I’ll walk,
 Till trav’ling days are done.</lyrics>
