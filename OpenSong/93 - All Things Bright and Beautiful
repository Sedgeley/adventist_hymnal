    <lyrics>[V1]
 
[C]
 All things bright and beautiful
 All creatures great and small
 All things wise and wonderful
 The Lord God made them all.
 
[V1]
 Each little flowâ€™r that opens
 Each little bird that sings
 He made their glowing colours
 He made their tiny wings.
 
[V2]
 The purple-headed mountain
 The river running by
 The sunset and the morning
 That brighten up the sky.
 
[V3]
 The cold wind in the winter
 The pleasant summer sun
 The ripe fruits in the garden
 He made them, every one.
 
[V4]
 He gave us eyes to see them
 And lips that we might tell
 How great is God Almighty
 Who has made all things well.</lyrics>
