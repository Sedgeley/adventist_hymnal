    <lyrics>[V1]
 Once to every man and nation,
 comes the moment to decide,
 In the strife of truth with falsehood,
 for the good or evil side;
 Some great cause, some great decision,
 offering each the bloom or blight,
 And the choice goes by forever,
 ’twixt that darkness and that light.
 
[V2]
 Then to side with truth is noble,
 when we share her wretched crust,
 Ere her cause bring fame and profit,
 and ’tis prosperous to be just;
 Then it is the brave man chooses
 while the coward stands aside,
 Till the multitude make virtue
 of the faith they had denied.
 
[V3]
 By the light of burning martyrs,
 Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,
 Toiling up new Calv’ries ever
 with the cross that turns not back;
 New occasions teach new duties,
 time makes ancient good uncouth,
 They must upward still and onward,
 who would keep abreast of truth.
 
[V4]
 Though the cause of evil prosper,
 yet the truth alone is strong;
 Though her portion be the scaffold,
 and upon the throne be wrong;
 Yet that scaffold sways the future,
 and behind the dim unknown,
 Standeth God within the shadow,
 keeping watch above His own.</lyrics>
