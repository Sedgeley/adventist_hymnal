    <lyrics>[V1]
 Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise!
 All praise to Him belongs;
 Who kindly lengthens out our days,
 In spires our choicest songs,
 Inspires our choicest songs.
 
[V2]
 His providence hath brought us through
 Another various year;
 We all, with vows and anthems new,
 Before our God appear,
 Before our God appear.
 
[V3]
 O God, Thy mercies past we own,
 And Thy continued care;
 To Thee presenting through Thy Son
 What e’er we have and are,
 What e’er we have and are.</lyrics>
