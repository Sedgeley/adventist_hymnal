    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord in Zion reigneth,
 let all the world rejoice,
 And come before His throne of grace
 with tuneful heart and voice;
 The Lord in Zion reigneth,
 and there His praise shall ring,
 To Him shall princes bend the knee
 and kings their glory bring.
 
[V2]
 The Lord in Zion reigneth,
 and who so great as He?
 The depths of earth are in His hands;
 He rules the mighty sea.
 O crown His Name with honor,
 and let His standard wave,
 Till distant isles beyond the deep
 shall own His power to save.
 
[V3]
 The Lord in Zion reigneth,
 these hours to Him belong;
 O enter now His temple gates,
 and fill His courts with song;
 Beneath His royal banner
 let every creature fall,
 Exalt the King of heaven and earth,
 and crown Him Lord of all.</lyrics>
