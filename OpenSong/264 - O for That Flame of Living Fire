    <lyrics>[V1]
 O for that flame of living fire
 Which shone so bright in saints of old;
 Which bade their souls to heaven aspire,
 Calm in distress, in danger bold!
 
[V2]
 Where is that spirit, Lord, which dwelt
 In Abram’s breast, and sealed Him Thine?
 Which made Paul’s heart with sorrow melt,
 And glow with energy divine?
 
[V3]
 That spirit which from age to age
 Proclaimed Thy love, and taught Thy ways?
 Brightened Isaiah’s vivid page,
 And breathed in David’s hallowed lays?
 
[V4]
 Is not Thy grace as mighty now
 As when Elijah felt its power?
 When glory beamed from Moses’ brow,
 Or Job endured the trying hour?
 
[V5]
 Remember, Lord, the ancient days;
 Renew Thy work, Thy grace restore;
 And while to Thee our hearts we raise,
 On us Thy Holy Spirit pour.</lyrics>
