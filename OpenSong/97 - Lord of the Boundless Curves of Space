    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord of the boundless curves of space
 And time’s deep mystery,
 To Your creative might we trace
 All nature’s energy.
 
[V2]
 Your mind conceived the galaxy,
 Each atom’s secret planned,
 And every age of history
 Your purpose, Lord, has spanned.
 
[V3]
 Yours is the image stamped on man,
 Though marred by man’s own sin;
 And Yours the liberating plan
 Again his soul to win.
 
[V4]
 Give us to know Your truth; but more,
 The strength to do Your will;
 Until the love our souls adore
 Shall all our being fill.</lyrics>
