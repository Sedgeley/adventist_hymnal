    <lyrics>[V1]
 When I survey the wondrous cross
 on which the Prince of Glory died;
 my richest gain I count but loss,
 and pour contempt on all my pride.
 
[V2]
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
 save in the death of Christ, my God;
 all the vain things that charm me most,
 I sacrifice them to his blood.
 
[V3]
 See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
 sorrow and love flow mingled down.
 Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet,
 or thorns compose so rich a crown.
 
[V4]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
 that were an offering far too small;
 love so amazing, so divine,
 demands my soul, my life, my all.</lyrics>
