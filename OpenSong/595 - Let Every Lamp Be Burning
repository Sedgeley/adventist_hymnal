    <lyrics>[V1]
 Let every lamp be burning bright,
 The darkest hour is nearing;
 The darkest hour of earth’s long night,
 Before the Lord’s appearing.
 
[C]
 Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,
 Then trim your lamps with godly fear;
 The Master’s coming draweth near,
 Let every lamp be burning.
 
[V2]
 Though thousands calmly slumber on,
 The last great message spuring,
 Wel’ll rest our living faith upon
 His promise of returning.
 
[V3]
 His word our lamp, His truth our guide,
 We cannot be mistaken;
 Though dangers rise on every side,
 We shall not be forsaken.
 
[V4]
 Then let good works with faith appear,
 To help the world atound us;
 Obedience bring the blessing near
 When faith has firmly bound us.</lyrics>
