    <lyrics>[V1]
 O, for a faith that will not shrink,
 Though pressed by many a foe,
 That will not tremble on the brink of poverty,
 Of poverty or woe; Of poverty or woe;
 
[V2]
 That will not murmur or complain
 Beneath the chastening rod,
 But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain
 Can lean upon its God; Can lean upon its God.
 
[V3]
 A faith that shines more bright and clear
 When tempests rage without;
 That when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear,
 In darkness feels no doubt; In darkness feels no doubt.
 
[V4]
 That bears unmoved the world’s dread frown,
 Nor heeds its scornful smile;
 That sin’s wild ocean cannot drown, no, cannot drown,
 Nor its soft arts beguile; Nor its soft arts beguile.
 
[V5]
 Lord, give me such a faith as this,
 And then, whate’er may come
 I’ll taste, e’en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss
 Of an eternal home; Of an eternal home.</lyrics>
