    <lyrics>[V1]
 Now that the daylight fills the sky,
 We lift our hearts to God on high,
 That He, in all we do or say,
 Would keep us free from harm today;
 
[V2]
 Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;
 From anger’s din would shield our life;
 From evil sights would turn our eyes,
 And close our ears to vanities;
 
[V3]
 So we, when this new day is gone
 And night in turn is drawing on,
 With conscience by the world unstained
 Shall praise His name for vict’ry gained.
 
[V4]
 “All praise to You, creator Lord!
 All praise to You, eternal Word!
 All praise to You, O Spirit wise!”
 We sing as daylight fills the skies.</lyrics>
