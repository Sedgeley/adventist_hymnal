    <lyrics>[V1]
 Under His wings I am safely abiding;
 Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
 Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;
 he has redeemed me, and I am His child.
 
[C]
 Under His wings, under His wings,
 Who from His love can sever?
 Under His wings, my soul shall abide,
 Safely abide forever.
 
[V2]
 Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
 How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
 Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
 There I find comfort, and there I am blest.
 
[V3]
 Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!
 There will I hide till life’s trials are over;
 Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
 Resting in Jesus I’m safe evermore.</lyrics>
