    <lyrics>[V1]
 Work for the night is coming,
 Work through the morning hours;
 Work while the dew is sparkling;
 Work ‘mid springing flow’rs.
 Work when the day grows brighter,
 Work in the glowing sun;
 Work for the night is coming,
 When man’s work is done.
 
[V2]
 Work for the night is coming,
 Work thro’ the sunny noon;
 Fill brightest hours with labor,
 Rest comes sure and soon.
 Give every flying minute
 Something to keep in store;
 Work for the night is coming,
 When man works no more.
 
[V3]
 Work for the night is coming,
 Under the sunset skies;
 While their bright tints are glowing,
 Work for daylight flies.
 Work till the last beam fadeth,
 Fadeth to shine no more;
 Work while the night is dark’ning,
 When man’s work is o’er.</lyrics>
