    <lyrics>[V1]
 Great our joy as now we gather
 Where the Master makes us one:
 Where we worship God the Father
 Thro’ the Spirit of His Son.
 All who search for His church
 Find it where His will is done.
 
[V2]
 Precious is the tie that binds us
 To our God when faith grows cold;
 Precious all that now reminds us
 He is still our safe stronghold.
 Faithful love serves to prove
 Here the Shepherd has His fold.
 
[V3]
 May we learn from Christ’s example
 How to use this house of prayer:
 He who loved and cleansed His temple
 Wants us all to worship there.
 God the Son shuts out none:
 In His kingdom all may share.
 
[V4]
 Lord, inspire us with Your vision
 Of a world which must be won!
 Glorious is the church’s mission,
 Long endeavoured, scarce begun!
 Faithful now – this is how
 God’s eternal will is done.</lyrics>
