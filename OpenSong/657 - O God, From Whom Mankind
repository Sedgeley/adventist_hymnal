    <lyrics>[V1]
 O God from whom mankind derives its name;
 Whose covenant of grace remains the same,
 Be with these two who now before You wait;
 Enlarge the love they come to consecrate.
 
[V2]
 May through their union other lives be blessed;
 Their door be wide to stranger and to guest,
 Give them the understanding that is kind,
 Grant them the blessing of an open mind.
 
[V3]
 Preserve their days from inwardness of hear;
 To each the gift of truthful speech impart.
 Their bond be strong against all strain and strife
 Amid the changes of this earthly life.
 
[V4]
 From stage to stage on lifeâ€™s unfolding way
 Bring to their mind the vows they make this day,
 Your Spirit be their Guide in every move,
 Their faith in Christ the basis of their love.</lyrics>
