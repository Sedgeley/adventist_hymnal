    <lyrics>[V1]
 Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
 Thru eternal ages let His praises ring;
 Glory in the highest I will shout and sing,
 Standing on the promises of God.
 
[C]
 Standing, standing,
 Standing on the promises
 of God my Savior;
 Standing, standing,
 I’m standing on the promises of God.
 
[V2]
 Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
 When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
 By the living word of God I shall prevail,
 Standing on the promises of God.
 
[V3]
 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
 Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,
 Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword,
 Standing on the promises of God.</lyrics>
