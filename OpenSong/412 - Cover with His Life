    <lyrics>[V1]
 Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;
 Father, impute His life unto me.
 My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
 Cover with His life, whiter than snow.
 
[C]
 Cover with His life, whiter than snow;
 Fullness of His life then shall I know;
 My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
 Cover with His life, whither than snow.
 
[V2]
 Deep are the wounds transgression has made;
 Red are the stains; my soul is afraid.
 O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,
 Safe from the law that now judgeth me!
 
[V3]
 Longing the joy of pardon to know;
 Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;
 “Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,
 Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.”
 
[V4]
 Reconciled by His death for my sin,
 Justified by His life pure and clean,
 Sanctified by obeying His word,
 Glorified when returneth my Lord.</lyrics>
