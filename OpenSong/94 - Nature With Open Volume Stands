    <lyrics>[V1]
 Nature with open volume stands,
 To spread its Maker’s praise abroad;
 And every labor of His hands
 Shows something worthy of our God.
 
[V2]
 But in the grace that rescued us
 His brightest form of glory shines;
 ‘Tis fairest drawn upon the cross
 In precious blood and crimson lines.
 
[V3]
 Here His whole name appears complete.
 Nor wit can guess, nor reason prove,
 Which of the letters best is writ,
 The pow’r, the wisdom, or the love.
 
[V4]
 We would forever speak His name
 In sounds to mortal ears unknown,
 With angels join to praise the Lamb,
 And worship at His Father’s throne.</lyrics>
