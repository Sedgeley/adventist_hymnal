    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!
 Behold the King of glory waits;
 The King of kings is drawing near,
 The Savior of the world is here.
 
[V2]
 The Lord is just, a helper tried;
 Mercy is ever at His side;
 His kingly crowns is holiness,
 His scepter, pity in distress.
 
[V3]
 O blest the land, the city blest,
 Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!
 O happy hearts and happy homes
 To whom this King in triumph comes!
 
[V4]
 Fling wide the portals of your heart;
 Make it a temple, set apart
 From earthly use for heavenâ€™s employ,
 Adorned with prayer, and love, and joy.
 
[V5]
 Redeemer, come; I open wide
 My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide.
 Let me Thy inner presence feel,
 Thy grace and love in me reveal.</lyrics>
