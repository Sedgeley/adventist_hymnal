    <lyrics>[V1]
 Unto the hills around shall I
 lift up my longing eyes?
 O whence for me shall my salvation come,
 from whence arise?
 From God the Lord
 doth come my certain aid,
 From God the Lord,
 who heav’n and earth hath made.
 
[V2]
 He will not suffer that thy foot
 be moved; safe shalt Thou be.
 No careless slumber shall
 His eyelids close, who keepeth thee.
 Behold our God, the Lord,
 He slumbereth ne’er,
 Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.
 
[V3]
 Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true,
 thy changeless shade.
 Jehovah they defense on thy
 right hand Himself hath made.
 And thee no sun by day
 shall ever smite,
 No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.
 
[V4]
 From every evil shall He keep
 thy soul, from every sin;
 Jehovah shall preserve thy
 going out, thy coming in.
 Above thee watching, He,
 whom we adore,
 Shall keep thee henceforth,
 yea, forevermore.</lyrics>
