    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christ upon the mountain peak
 Stands alone in glory blazing;
 Let us, if we dare to speak,
 With the saints and angels praise Him:
 
[C]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
 
[V2]
 Trembling at His feet we saw
 Moses and Elijah speaking;
 All the prophets and the law
 Shout thro’ them their joyful greeting:
 
[C]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
 
[V3]
 Swift the cloud of glory came,
 God proclaiming in the thunder
 Jesus as His Son by name;
 Nations cry aloud in wonder!
 
[C]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
 
[V4]
 This is God’s beloved Son:
 Law and prophets fade before Him;
 First and last, the only One,
 Let creation now adore Him.
 
[C]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.</lyrics>
