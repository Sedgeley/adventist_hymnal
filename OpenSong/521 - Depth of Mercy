    <lyrics>[V1]
 Depth of mercy!â€“can there be
 Mercy still reserved for me?
 Can my God His wrath forbear?
 Me, the chief of sinners, spare?
 
[V2]
 I have long withstood His grace,
 Long provoked Him to His face,
 Would not hearken to His calls,
 Grieved Him by a thousand falls.
 
[V3]
 Now incline me to repent;
 Let me now my sins lament;
 Now my foul revolt deplore,
 Weep, believe, and sin no more.
 
[V4]
 There for me the Savior stands,
 Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;
 God is love! I know, I feel;
 Jesus weeps, and loves me still.</lyrics>
