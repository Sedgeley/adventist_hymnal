    <lyrics>[V1]
 O love of God, how strong and true!
 Eternal, and yet ever new;
 Uncomprehended and unbought,
 Beyond all knowledge and all thought.
 
[V2]
 O love of God, how deep and great,
 Far deeper than man’s deepest hate;
 Self-fed, self-kindled like the light,
 Changeless, eternal, infinite.
 
[V3]
 We read thee best in Him who cam
 To bear for us the cross of shame;
 Sent by the Father from on high,
 Our life to live, our death to die.
 
[V4]
 We read thy power to bless and save,
 E’en in the darkness of the grave;
 Still more in resurrection light
 We read the fullness of thy might.
 
[V5]
 O love of God, our shield and stay
 Through all the perils of our way!
 Eternal love, in thee we rest,
 Forever safe, forever blest.</lyrics>
