    <lyrics>[V1]
 Take my life, and let it be
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
 Take my hands, and let them move
 At the impulse of Thy love;
 At the impulse of Thy love.
 
[V2]
 Take my feet, and let them be
 Swift and beautiful for Thee.
 Take my voice, and let me sing
 Always, only, for my King;
 Always, only, for my King.
 
[V3]
 Take my lips, and let them be
 Filled with messages from Thee.
 Take my silver and my gold:
 Not a mite would I withhold;
 Not a mite would I withhold.
 
[V4]
 Take my will, and make it Thine,
 It shall be no longer mine;
 Take my heart, it is Thine own,
 It shall be Thy royal throne.
 It shall be Thy royal throne.
 
[V5]
 Take my love, my Lord, I pour
 At Thy feet its treasure store;
 Take myself, and I will be,
 Ever, only, all for Thee.
 Ever, only, all for Thee.</lyrics>
