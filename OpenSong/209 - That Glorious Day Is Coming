    <lyrics>[V1]
 That glorious day is coming,
 The hour is hastening on;
 Its radiant light is nearing,
 Far brighter than the sun;
 In yonder clouds of heaven,
 The Saviour will appear,
 And gather all His chosen,
 To meet Him in the air.
 The saints, then all victorious
 Will go to meet their Lord;
 An earth both bright and glorious,
 Will then be their reward;
 And God Himself there reigning,
 Will wipe all tears away;
 Nor clouds nor night remaining,
 But one eternal day.
 
[V2]
 O Christian, keep from sleeping,
 And let your love abound;
 Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,
 The trumpet soon will sound!
 O sinner, hear the warning!
 To Jesus quickly fly!
 Then you, in that blest morning,
 May meet Him in the sky!</lyrics>
