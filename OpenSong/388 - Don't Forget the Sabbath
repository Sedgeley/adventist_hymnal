    <lyrics>[V1]
 Don’t forget the Sabbath,
 The Lord our God hath blest,
 Of all the week the brightest,
 Of all the week the best;
 It brings repose from labor,
 It tells of joy divine,
 Its beams of light descending,
 With heavenly beauty shine.
 
[C]
 Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
 Blessed Sabbath day,
 Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
 Blessed Sabbath day.
 
[V2]
 Keep the Sabbath holy,
 And worship Him today,
 Who said to His disciples,
 “I am the living way;”
 And if we meekly follow
 Our Savior here below,
 He’ll give us of the fountain
 Whose streams eternal flow.
 
[V3]
 Day of sacred pleasure!
 Its golden hours we’ll spend
 In thankful hymns to Jesus,
 The children’s dearest Friend;
 O gentle loving, Savior,
 How good and kind Thou art,
 How precious is Thy promise
 To dwell in every heart!</lyrics>
