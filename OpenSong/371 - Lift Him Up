    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lift Him up, ’tis He that bids you,
 Let the dying look and live;
 To all weary, thirsting sinners,
 Living waters will He give;
 And though once so meek and lowly,
 Yet the Prince of heaven was He;
 And the blind, who grope in darkness,
 Through the blood of Christ shall see.
 
[C]
 Lift Him up, the risen Savior,
 High amid the waiting throng;
 Lift Him up, ’tis He that speaketh,
 Now He bids you flee from wrong.
 
[V2]
 Lift Him up, this precious Savior,
 Let the multitude behold;
 They with willing hearts shall seek Him,
 He will draw them to His fold;
 They shall gather from the wayside,
 Hastening on with joyous feet,
 They shall bear the cross of Jesus,
 And shall find salvation sweet.
 
[V3]
 Lift Him up in all His glory,
 ‘Tis the Son of God on high;
 Lift Him up, His love shall draw them,
 Eén the careless shall draw nigh;
 Let them hear again the story
 Of the cross, the death of shame;
 And from tongue to tongue repeat it;
 Mighty throngs shall bless His name.
 
[V4]
 O then lift Him up in singing,
 Lift the Savior up in prayer;
 He, the glorious Redeemer,
 All the sins of men did bear;
 Yes, the young shall bow before Him,
 And the old their voices raise;
 All the deaf shall hear hosannah;
 And the dumb shall shout His praise.</lyrics>
