    <lyrics>[V1]
 As with gladness men of old
 Did the guiding star behold,
 As with joy they hailed its light,
 Leading onward, beaming bright,
 So, most gracious Lord, may we
 Evermore be led to Thee.
 
[V2]
 As with joyful steps they sped
 To that lowly manger bed,
 There to bend the knee before
 Him whom heav’n and earth adore,
 So may we with willing feet
 Ever seek Thy mercy seat.
 
[V3]
 As they offered gifts most rare
 At that manger rude and bare,
 So may we with holy joy,
 Pure, and free from sin’s alloy,
 All our costliest treasures bring,
 Christ, to Thee our heav’nly King.
 
[V4]
 Holy Jesus, every day
 Keep us in the narrow way;
 And, when earthly things are past,
 Bring our ransomed souls at last
 Where they need no star to guide,
 Where no clouds Thy glory hide.</lyrics>
