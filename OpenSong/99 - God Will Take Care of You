    <lyrics>[V1]
 Be not dismayed whate’er betide,
 God will take care of you;
 beneath his wings of love abide,
 God will take care of you.
 
[C]
 God will take care of you,
 through every day, o’er all the way;
 he will take care of you,
 God will take care of you.
 
[V2]
 Through days of toil when heart doth fail,
 God will take care of you;
 when dangers fierce your path assail,
 God will take care of you.
 
[V3]
 All you may need he will provide,
 God will take care of you;
 nothing you ask will be denied,
 God will take care of you.
 
[V4]
 No matter what may be the test,
 God will take care of you;
 lean, weary one, upon his breast,
 God will take care of you.</lyrics>
