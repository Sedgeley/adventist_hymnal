    <lyrics>[V1]
 Long upon the mountains weary,
 Have the scattered flocks been torn;
 Dark the dessert paths, and dreary;
 Grievous trials have they borne.
 Now the gathering call is sounding,
 Solemn in its warning voice;
 Union, faith, and love, abounding,
 Bid the little flock rejoice.
 
[V2]
 Now the light of truth they’re seeking,
 In its onward track pursue;
 All the ten commandments keeping,
 They are holy, just, and true.
 On the words of lire they’re feeding,
 Precious to their taste so sweet;
 All their Master’s percepts heeding,
 Bowing humbly to His feet.
 
[V3]
 In that light of light and beauty,
 In that golden city fair,
 Soon its pearly gates they’ll enter,
 And of all its glories share.
 There, divine the soul’s expansions;
 Free from sin, and death, and pain;
 Tear will never dim those mansions
 Where the souls immortal reign.
 
[V4]
 Soon He comes! With clouds descending;
 All His saints, entombed arise;
 The redeemed, in anthems blending,
 Shout their vict’ry thro’ the skies.
 O, we long for Thine appearing;
 Come, O Savior, quickly come!
 Blessed hope! Our spirits cheering,
 Take thy ransomed children home.</lyrics>
