    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christian, seek not yet repose,
 Cast thy dreams of ease away;
 Thou aret in teh midst of foes;
 Watch and pray!
 
[V2]
 Gird thy heavenly armor on,
 Wear it ever, night and day;
 Ambushed lies the evil one;
 Watch and pray!
 
[V3]
 Hear the victors who o’ercame;
 Still they mark each warrior’s way;
 All with one sweet voice exclaim:
 “Watch and pray!”
 
[V4]
 Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
 Him thou lovest to obey;
 Hide within thy heart His word;
 “Watch and pray!”
 
[V5]
 Watch, as if on that alone Hung
 the issue of teh day;
 Pray that help may be send down;
 Watch and pray!</lyrics>
