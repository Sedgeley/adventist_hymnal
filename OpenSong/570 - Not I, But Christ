    <lyrics>[V1]
 Not I, but Christ, be honored, loved, exalted;
 Not I, but Christ, be seen, be known, be heard;
 Not I, but Christ, in every look and action,
 Not I, but Christ, in every thought and word.
 
[V2]
 Not I, but Christ, to gently soothe in sorrow,
 Not I, but Christ, to wipe the falling tear;
 Not I, but Christ, to lift the weary burden,
 Not I, but Christ, to hush away all fear.
 
[V3]
 Christ, only Christ! No idle words e’er falling,
 Christ, only Christ; no needless bustling sound;
 Christ, only Christ, no self important bearing;
 Christ, only Christ, no trace of “I” be found.
 
[V4]
 Not I, but Christ, my every need supplying,
 Not I, but Christ, my strength and health to be;
 Christ, only Christ, for body, soul, and spirit,
 Christ, only Christ, here and eternally.</lyrics>
