    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jerusalem, my happy home,
 O how I long for thee!
 When will my sorrows have an end,
 The joys when shall I see?
 
[V2]
 The walls are all of precious stone,
 Most glorious to behold;
 Thy gates are richly set with pearl,
 Thy streets are paved with gold.
 
[V3]
 Thy garden and thy pleasant walks
 My study long have been;
 Such dazzling views by human sight
 Have never yet been seen.
 
[V4]
 Lord, help us by Thy mighty grace,
 To keep in view the prize,
 Till Thou dost come to take us home
 To that blessed paradise.</lyrics>
