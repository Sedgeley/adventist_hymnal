    <lyrics>[V1]
 The church’s one foundation
 is Jesus Christ her Lord;
 she is his new creation
 by water and the Word.
 From heaven he came and sought her
 to be his holy bride;
 with his own blood he bought her,
 and for her life he died.
 
[V2]
 Elect from every nation,
 yet one o’er all the earth;
 her charter of salvation,
 one Lord, one faith, one birth;
 one holy name she blesses,
 partakes one holy food,
 and to one hope she presses,
 with every grace endued.
 
[V3]
 Though with a scornful wonder
 we see her sore oppressed,
 by schisms rent asunder,
 by heresies distressed,
 yet saints their watch are keeping;
 their cry goes up, “How long?”
 And soon the night of weeping
 shall be the morn of song.
 
[V4]
 ‘Mid toil and tribulation,
 and tumult of her war,
 she waits the consummation
 of peace forevermore;
 till, with the vision glorious,
 her longing eyes are blest,
 and the great church victorious
 shall be the church at rest.</lyrics>
