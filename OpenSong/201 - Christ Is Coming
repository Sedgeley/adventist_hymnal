    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christ is coming! let creation
 Bid her groans and travail cease;
 Let the glorious proclamation
 Hope restore and faith increase;
 Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!
 (Prince of Peace!)
 Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!
 
[V2]
 Earth can now but tell the story
 Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
 She shall yet behold Thy glory
 When Thou comest back to reign;
 Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 Let each heart repeat the strain.
 (repeat the strain)
 Let each heart repeat the strain.
 
[V3]
 With that “blessed hope” before us,
 Let no harp remain unstrung;
 Let the mighty advent chorus
 Onward roll from tongue to tongue:
 Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
 (quickly come!)
 Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!</lyrics>
