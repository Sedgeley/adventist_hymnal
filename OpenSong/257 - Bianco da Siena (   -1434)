    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come down, O Love divine,
 seek thou this soul of mine
 and visit it with thine
 own ardor glowing;
 O Comforter, draw near,
 within my heart appear,
 and kindle it,
 thy holy flame bestowing.
 
[V2]
 O let it freely burn,
 till earthly passions turn
 to dust and ashes
 in its heat consuming;
 and let thy glorious light
 shine ever on my sight,
 and clothe me round,
 the while my path illuming.
 
[V3]
 Let holy charity Mine
 outward vesture be,
 And lowliness become
 my inner clothing;
 True lowliness of heart
 which takes the humbler part,
 And oâ€™er its own shortcomings
 weeps with loathing.
 
[V4]
 And so the yearning strong
 with which the soul will long
 shall far out pass the power of human telling;
 for none can guess its grace, till Love create a place
 wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling.</lyrics>
