    <lyrics>[V1]
 O Master, let me walk with thee
 in lowly paths of service free;
 tell me thy secret; help me bear
 the strain of toil, the fret of care.
 
[V2]
 Help me the slow of heart to move
 by some clear, winning word of love;
 teach me the wayward feet to stay,
 and guide them in the homeward way.
 
[V3]
 Teach me thy patience; still with thee
 in closer, dearer company,
 in work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
 in trust that triumphs over wrong;
 
[V4]
 In hope that sends a shining ray
 far down the futureâ€™s broadening way,
 in peace that only thou canst give,
 with thee, O Master, let me live.</lyrics>
