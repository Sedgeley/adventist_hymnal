    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord is coming, let this be
 The herald note of jubilee;
 And when we meet and when we part
 The salutation from the heart.
 
[C]
 The Lord is coming, let this be
 The herald note of jubilee,
 The herald note of jubilee.
 
[V2]
 The Lord is coming, sound it forth
 From east to west, from south to north;
 Speed on! Speed on the tidings glad,
 That none who love Him may be sad.
 
[C]
 The Lord is coming, let this be
 The herald note of jubilee,
 The herald note of jubilee.
 
[V3]
 The Lord is coming, swift and sure
 And all His judgements shall endure,
 And none can hope to escape His wrath,
 Who walk not in the narrow path.
 
[C]
 The Lord is coming, let this be
 The herald note of jubilee,
 The herald note of jubilee.
 
[V4]
 This earth, with her ten thousand wrongs
 Will soon be tuned to nobler songs;
 Our praise shall then, in realms of light,
 With all His universe unite.
 
[C]
 The Lord is coming, let this be
 The herald note of jubilee,
 The herald note of jubilee.</lyrics>
