    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Savior is waiting
 to enter your heart
 Why don’t you let Him come in?
 There’s nothing in this world
 to keep you apart
 What is your answer to Him?
 
[C]
 Time after time
 He has waited before
 And now He is waiting again
 To see if you are willing
 To open the door
 Oh, how He wants to come in.
 
[V2]
 If you’ll take one step
 Toward the Savior, my friend,
 You’ll find His arms open wide.
 Receive Him, and all of
 your darkness will end
 Within your heart He’ll abide.</lyrics>
