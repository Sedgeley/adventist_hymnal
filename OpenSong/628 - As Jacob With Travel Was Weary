    <lyrics>[V1]
 As Jacob with travel was weary one day,
 At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;
 He saw in a vision a ladder so high
 That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.
 
[C]
 Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
 And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,
 And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.
 
[V2]
 Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;
 For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:
 And remember each step that by faith we passo’er,
 Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.
 
[V3]
 And when we arrive at the haven of rest
 We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest,
 Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”
 O who would not climb such a ladder as this?</lyrics>
