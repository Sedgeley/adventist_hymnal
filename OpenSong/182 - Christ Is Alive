    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christ is alive!
 Let Christians sing.
 His cross stands empty to the sky.
 Let streets and homes with praises ring.
 His love in death shall never die.
 
[V2]
 Christ is alive!
 No longer bound
 To distant years in Palestine,
 He comes to claim the here and now
 And conquer every place and time.
 
[V3]
 In every insult,
 rift, and war
 Where color, scorn or wealth divide,
 He suffers still, yet loves the more,
 And lives, though ever crucified.
 
[V4]
 Christ is alive!
 Ascended Lord
 He rules the world His Father made,
 Till, in the end, His love adored
 Shall be to all on earth displayed.</lyrics>
