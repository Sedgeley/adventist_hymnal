    <lyrics>[V1]
 O love, how deep, how broad, how high,
 Beyond all thought and fantasy,
 That God, the Son of God, should take
 Our mortal form for mortalâ€™s sake!
 
[V2]
 For us baptized, for us He bore
 His holy fast and hungered sore;
 For us temptation sharp He knew;
 For us the tempter overthrew.
 
[V3]
 For us by wickedness betrayed,
 For us, in crown of thorns arrayed,
 He bore the shameful cross and death;
 For us He gave His dying breath.
 
[V4]
 For us He rose from death again,
 For us He went on high to reign;
 For us He sent His Spirit here
 To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.
 
[V5]
 All glory to our Lord and God
 For love so deep, so high, so broad;
 The Trinity whom we adore
 Forevermore and forevermore.</lyrics>
