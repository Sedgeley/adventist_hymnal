    <lyrics>[V1]
 Nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
 E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
 still all my song shall be,
 nearer, my God, to thee;
 nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
 
[V2]
 Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
 darkness be over me, my rest a stone;
 yet in my dreams I’d be
 nearer, my God, to thee;
 nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
 
[V3]
 There let the way appear, steps unto heaven;
 all that thou sendest me, in mercy given;
 angels to beckon me
 nearer, my God, to thee;
 nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
 
[V4]
 Then, with my waking thoughts bright with thy praise,
 out of my stony griefs Bethel I’ll raise;
 so by my woes to be
 nearer, my God, to thee;
 nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
 
[V5]
 Or if, on joyful wing cleaving the sky,
 sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I fly,
 still all my song shall be,
 nearer, my God, to thee;
 nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!</lyrics>
