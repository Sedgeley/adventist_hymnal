    <lyrics>[V1]
 Oh now I see the crimson wave,
 The fountain deep and wide;
 Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
 Points to His wounded side.
 
[C]
 The cleansing stream I see, I see,
 I plunge, and O, it cleanseth me!
 O praise the Lord! it cleanseth me,
 It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.
 
[V2]
 I see the new creation rise,
 I hear the speaking blood;
 It speaks polluted nature dies,
 Sinks ‘neath the cleansing flood.
 
[V3]
 I rise to walk in heaven’s own light,
 Above the world and sin;
 With heart made pure and garments white,
 And Christ enthroned within.
 
[V4]
 Amazing grace! ’tis heaven below
 To feel the blood applied,
 And Jesus, only Jesus, know,
 My Jesus crucified.</lyrics>
