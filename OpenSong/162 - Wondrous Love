    <lyrics>[V1]
 What wondrous love is this,
 O my soul, O my soul?
 What wondrous love is this, O my soul?
 What wondrous love is this
 That caused the Lord of bliss
 To bear the dreadful curse
 for my soul, for my soul;
 To bear the dreadful curse
 for my soul, for my soul;
 
[V2]
 To God and to the Lamb
 I will sing, I will sing;
 To God and to the Lamb, I will sing;
 To God and to the Lamb
 Who is the great I am,
 While millions join the theme,
 I will sing, I will sing;
 While millions join the theme,
 I will sing, I will sing;
 
[V3]
 And when from death I’m free,
 I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on;
 And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on;
 And when from death I’m free,
 I’ll sing and joyful be,
 And through eternity
 I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on!
 And through eternity,
 I’ll sing on.</lyrics>
