    <lyrics>[V1]
 O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
 My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
 So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine, would I be;
 Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.
 
[C]
 Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
 Thou blest “Rock of Ages,”
 I’m hiding in Thee.
 
[V2]
 In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow’s lone hour,
 In times when temptation casts over me its power;
 In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
 Thou blest “Rock of Ages,“ I’m hiding in Thee.
 
[V3]
 How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
 I have fled to my refuge and breathed out my woe;
 How often, when trials like sea billows roll,
 Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.</lyrics>
