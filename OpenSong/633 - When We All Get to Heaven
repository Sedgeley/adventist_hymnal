    <lyrics>[V1]
 Sing the wondrous love of Jesus;
 Sing his mercy and his grace.
 In the mansions bright and blessed
 He’ll prepare for us a place.
 
[C]
 When we all get to heaven,
 What a day of rejoicing that will be!
 When we all see Jesus,
 We’ll sing and shout the victory!
 
[V2]
 While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
 Clouds will overspread the sky;
 But when traveling days are over,
 Not a shadow, not a sigh.
 
[V3]
 Let us then be true and faithful,
 Trusting, serving every day;
 Just one glimpse of him in glory
 Will the toils of life repay.
 
[V4]
 Onward to the prize before us!
 Soon his beauty we’ll behold;
 Soon the pearly gates will open;
 We shall tread the streets of gold.</lyrics>
