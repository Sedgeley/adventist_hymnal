    <lyrics>[V1]
 Rejoice, the Lord is King!
 Your Lord and King adore!
 Rejoice, give thanks,
 and sing and triumph evermore
 Lift up your heart,
 lift up your voice!
 Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
 
[V2]
 Jesus, the Savior, reigns,
 The God of truth and love;
 When He had purged our stains,
 He took His seat above
 Lift up your heart,
 lift up your voice!
 Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
 
[V3]
 His kingdom cannot fail,
 He rules oâ€™er earth and heaven
 The keys of death and grave
 Are to our Jesus given
 Lift up your heart,
 lift up your voice!
 Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
 
[V4]
 Rejoice in glorious hope!
 Our Lord the judge shall come,
 And take His servants up
 To their eternal home
 Lift up your heart,
 lift up your voice!
 Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</lyrics>
