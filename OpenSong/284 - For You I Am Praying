    <lyrics>[V1]
 I have a Savior,
 He’s pleading in glory,
 A dear, loving Savior,
 though earth friends be few;
 And now He is watching
 in tenderness o’er me,
 But oh that my Savior
 were your Savior, too.
 
[C]
 For you I am praying,
 For you I am Praying,
 For you am I praying,
 I’m praying for you.
 
[V2]
 I have a Father;
 to me He has given
 A hope for eternity,
 blessed and true;
 And soon He will call
 to meet Him in heaven,
 But oh that He’d let me
 bring you with me, too!
 
[V3]
 I have a robe;
 ’tis resplendent in whiteness,
 Awaiting in glory
 my wondering view;
 Oh, when I receive it,
 all shining in brightness,
 Dear friend, could I see you
 receiving one, too!
 
[V4]
 When Jesus has found you,
 tell others the story,
 That my loving Savior
 is your Savior, too;
 Then pray that your Savior
 will bring them to glory,
 And prayer will be answered
 ’twas answered for you!</lyrics>
