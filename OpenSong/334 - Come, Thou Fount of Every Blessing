    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
 Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
 Call for songs of loudest praise.
 Teach me ever to adore Thee,
 May I still Thy goodness prove,
 While the hope of endless glory
 Fills my heart with joy and love.
 
[V2]
 Here I raise mine Ebenezer;
 Hither by thy help I’ve come;
 And I hope, by thy good pleasure,
 Safely to arrive at home.
 Jesus sought me when a stranger,
 Wandering from the fold of God;
 He, to rescue me from danger,
 Interposed his precious blood.
 
[V3]
 O, to grace how great a debtor
 Daily I’m constrained to be!
 Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
 Bind me closer still to thee.
 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
 Prone to leave the God I love;
 Here’s my heart–O, take and seal it,
 Seal it for thy courts above.</lyrics>
