    <lyrics>[V1]
 Good Christians, now rejoice,
 With heart, and soul, and voice;
 Give ye heed to what we say:
 Jesus Christ is born today;
 Ox and ass before Him bow,
 And He is in the manger now.
 Crist is born today!
 Crist is born today!
 
[V2]
 Good Christians, now rejoice,
 With heart, and soul, and voice;
 Now ye hear of endless bliss:
 Jesus Christ was born for this!
 He hath ope’d the heav’nly door,
 And we are blessed evermore.
 Christ was born for this!
 Christ was born for this!
 
[V3]
 Good Christians, now rejoice,
 With heart, and soul, and voice;
 Now ye need not fear the grave:
 Jesus Christ was born to save!
 Calls you one and calls you all
 To gain His everlasting hall.
 Christ was born to save!
 Christ was born to save!</lyrics>
