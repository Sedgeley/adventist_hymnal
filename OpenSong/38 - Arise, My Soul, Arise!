    <lyrics>[V1]
 Arise, my soul, arise!
 Stretch forth to things eternal
 And hasten to the feet of your Redeemer God.
 Though hid from mortal eyes,
 He dwells in light supernal;
 Yet worship Him in humbleness and call Him Lord.
 His banquet of love
 Awaits you above;
 Yet here He grants a foretaste of the feast
 to come!
 Rejoice, my soul, rejoice,
 To heav’n lift up your voice:
 Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
 
[V2]
 Now hear the harps of heav’n!
 Oh, hear the song victorious,
 The never-ending anthem sounding
 through the sky!
 To mortals is not giv’n
 To join in strains so glorious;
 Yet here on earth we too can sing
 our praises high!
 He bought with His blood
 The ransomed of God;
 To Him be everlasting pow’r and victory.
 And let the great amen
 Resound through heav’n again.
 Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!</lyrics>
