    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christ the Lord is risen today, Alleluia!
 Sons of man and angels say, Alleluia!
 Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia!
 Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply, Alleluia!
 
[V2]
 Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia!
 Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia!
 Once he died our souls to save, Alleluia!
 Where’s thy victory, boasting grave? Alleluia!
 
[V3]
 Love’s redeeming work is done, Alleluia!
 Fought the fight, the battle won, Alleluia!
 Death in vain forbids him rise, Alleluia!
 Christ has opened paradise, Alleluia!
 
[V4]
 Soar we now where Christ has led, Alleluia!
 Following our exalted Head, Alleluia!
 Made like him, like him we rise, Alleluia!
 Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, Alleluia!</lyrics>
