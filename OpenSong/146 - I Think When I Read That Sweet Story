    <lyrics>[V1]
 I think when I read that sweet story of old,
 When Jesus was here among men,
 How He called little children as lambs to His fold,
 I should like to have been with Him then.
 
[V2]
 I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,
 That His arm had been thrown around me,
 And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,
 “Let the little ones come unto Me.”
 
[V3]
 I long for the joy of that glorious time,
 The sweetest and brightest and best,
 When the dear little children of every clime
 Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.</lyrics>
