    <lyrics>[V1]
 This is My will, My one command,
 That love should dwell among you all.
 This is My will that you should love
 As I have shown that I love you.
 
[V2]
 No greater love a man can have
 Than that he die to save his friends.
 You are My friends if you obey
 What I command that you should do.
 
[V3]
 You chose not Me, but I chose you
 That you should go and bear much fruit.
 I chose you out that you in Me
 Should bear much fruit that will abide.
 
[V4]
 All that I ask My Father, dear,
 For My nameâ€™s sake you shall receive.
 This is My will, My one command,
 That love should dwell in each, in all.</lyrics>
