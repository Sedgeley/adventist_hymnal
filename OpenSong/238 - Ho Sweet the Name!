    <lyrics>[V1]
 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
 In a believer’s ear!
 It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
 And drives away his fear.
 
[V2]
 It makes the wounded spirit whole,
 And calms the troubled breast;
 “Tis manna to the hungry soul,
 And to the weary, rest.
 
[V3]
 Dear name, the rock on which I build,
 My shield and hiding place,
 My neverfailing treasury, filled
 With boundless stores of grace.
 
[V4]
 Jesus! my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,
 My Prophet, Priest, and King!
 My Lord, my life, my way, my end!
 Accept the praise I bring.
 
[V5]
 Weak is the effort of my heart,
 And cold my warmest thought;
 But when I see Thee as Thou art,
 I’ll praise Thee as I ought.</lyrics>
