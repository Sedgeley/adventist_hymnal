    <lyrics>[V1]
 
[C]
 Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,
 Till all the world adore His sacred Name.
 
[V1]
 Come, Christians, follow where our Captain trod,
 Our King victorious, Christ, the Son of God.
 
[V2]
 Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
 The hosts of God in conquering ranks combine.
 
[V3]
 All newborn soldiers of the Crucified
 Bear on their brows the seal of Him Who died.
 
[V4]
 O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
 As Thou hast promised, draw us all to Thee.
 
[V5]
 So shall our song of triumph ever be:
 Praise to the Crucified for victory!</lyrics>
