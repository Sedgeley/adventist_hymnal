    <lyrics>[V1]
 When on life a darkness falls,
 When the mist flows chilling,
 Paths and sign posts lost in doubt,
 Loveless, unfulfilling,
 Reach us, Jesus, from Your cross,
 Though we feel forsaken;
 Keep us through the aching night
 Till new dawns awaken.
 
[V2]
 When the dreams and vows of youth
 Painfully accuse us,
 Stab our conscience, steal our worth,
 Christ will not refuse us:
 Peace the world cannot provide,
 Daily resurrection,
 Strong companion at our side
 For each new direction.
 
[V3]
 Come and meet Him, Friend and Lord,
 Throâ€™ the gospel story:
 Open door to life and peace,
 Window into glory.
 All who seek Him, soon are found,
 Made His close relation:
 Christ our pathway, Christ our home,
 Christ our sure foundation.</lyrics>
