    <lyrics>[V1]
 O holy Dove of God descending,
 You are the love that knows no ending.
 All of our shattered dreams Youâ€™re mending:
 Spirit, now live in me.
 
[V2]
 O holy Wind of God now blowing,
 You are the seed that God us sowing.
 You are the life that starts us growing:
 Spirit, now live in me.
 
[V3]
 O holy Rain of God now falling,
 You make the Word of God enthralling,
 You are that inner voice now calling:
 Spirit, now live in me.
 
[V4]
 O holy Flame of God now burning,
 You are the power of Christ returning.
 You are the answer to our yearning:
 Spirit, now live in me.</lyrics>
