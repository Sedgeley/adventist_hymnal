    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus calls us o’er the tumult
 of our life’s wild, restless sea;
 day by day his sweet voice soundeth,
 saying, “Christian, follow me!”
 
[V2]
 Jesus calls us from the worship
 of the vain world’s golden store,
 from each idol that would keep us,
 saying, “Christian, love me more!”
 
[V3]
 In our joys and in our sorrows,
 days of toil and hours of ease,
 still he calls, in cares and pleasures,
 “Christian, love me more than these!”
 
[V4]
 Jesus calls us! By thy mercies,
 Savior, may we hear thy call,
 give our hearts to thine obedience,
 serve and love thee best of all.</lyrics>
