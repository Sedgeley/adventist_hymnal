    <lyrics>[V1]
 When in our music God is glorified,
 And adoration leaves no room for pride,
 It is as though the whole creation cried:
 Alleluia!
 
[V2]
 How oft, in making music, we have found
 A new dimension in the world of sound,
 As worship moved us to a more profound
 Alleluia!
 
[V3]
 And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night
 When utmost evil strove against the light?
 Then let us sing for whom He won the fight:
 Alleluia!
 
[V4]
 Let every instrument be used for praise;
 Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise;
 And may God give us faith to sing always:
 Alleluia!</lyrics>
