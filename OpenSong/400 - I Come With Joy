    <lyrics>[V1]
 I come with joy to meet my Lord,
 Forgiven, loved and free,
 In awe and wonder to recall
 His life laid down for me,
 His life laid down for me.
 
[V2]
 I come with Christians far and near
 To find, as all are fed,
 Our true community of love
 In Christ’s communion bread,
 In Christ’s communion bread.
 
[V3]
 As Christ breaks bread for us to share
 Each proud division ends.
 That love that made us makes us one,
 And strangers now are friends,
 And strangers now are friends.
 
[V4]
 And thus with joy we meet our Lord.
 His presence always near,
 Is in such friendship better known:
 We see and praise Him here,
 We see and praise Him here.
 
[V5]
 Together met, together bound,
 We’ll go our diff’rent ways,
 And as His people in the world,
 We’ll live and speak His praise,
 We’ll live and speak His praise.</lyrics>
