    <lyrics>[V1]
 The Spirit of the Lord revealed
 His will to saints of old;
 Their heart and mind lips unsealed
 His glory to unfold.
 Amid the gloom of ancient night
 They hailed the dawning Word,
 And in the coming of the light
 Proclaimed the coming Lord.
 
[V2]
 The prophets passed; at length there came
 To sojourn and abide,
 The Word incarnate, to whose name
 The prophets testified;
 And He, the twilight overpast,
 Himself, the Light of light,
 As man with man, revealed at last
 The Father to our sight.
 
[V3]
 Eternal Spirit, who dost speak
 To mind and conscience still,
 That we in this our day, may seek
 To do our Fatherâ€™s will,
 To us the word of life impart,
 Of Christ, the living way;
 Give us the quiet, humble heart
 To hear and to obey.</lyrics>
