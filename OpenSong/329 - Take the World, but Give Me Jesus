    <lyrics>[V1]
 Take the world, but give me Jesus;
 All its Joys are but a name,
 But His love abideth ever,
 Through eternal years the same.
 
[C]
 Oh, the height and depth of mercy!
 Oh, the length and breadth of love!
 Oh, the fullness of redemption,
 Pledge of endless life above.
 
[V2]
 Take the world, but give me Jesus,
 Sweetest comfort of my soul;
 With my Savior watching o’er me,
 I can sing, though billows roll.
 
[V3]
 Take the world, but give me Jesus;
 Let me view his constant smile;
 Then throughout my pilgrim journey
 Light will cheer me all the while.
 
[V4]
 Take the world, but give me Jesus;
 In His cross my trust shall be,
 Till, with clearer, brighter vision
 Face to face my Lord I see.</lyrics>
