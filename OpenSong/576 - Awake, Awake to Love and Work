    <lyrics>[V1]
 Awake, awake to love and work!
 The lark is in the sky;
 The fields are wet with diamond dew;
 The worlds awake to cry
 Their blessings on the Lord of life,
 As He goes meekly by.
 
[V2]
 Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,
 Shout with their shout of praise;
 See how the giant sun soars up,
 Great lord of years and days!
 So let the love of Jesus come
 And set thy soul ablaze.
 
[V3]
 To give and give, and give again,
 What God hath given thee;
 To spend thyself nor count the cost;
 To serve right gloriously
 The God who gave all worlds that are,
 And all that are to be.</lyrics>
