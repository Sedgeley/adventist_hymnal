    <lyrics>[V1]
 Now let us from this table rise
 Renewed in body, mind, and soul;
 With Christ we die and live again,
 His selfless love has made us whole.
 
[V2]
 With minds alert, upheld by grace,
 To spread the word in speech and deed,
 We follow in the steps of Christ,
 At one with all in hope and need.
 
[V3]
 To fill each human house with love,
 It is the sacrament of care;
 The work that Christ began to do
 We humbly pledge ourselves to share.
 
[V4]
 Then grant us courage, Father God,
 To choose again the pilgrim way
 And help us to accept with joy
 The challenge of tomorrowâ€™s day.</lyrics>
