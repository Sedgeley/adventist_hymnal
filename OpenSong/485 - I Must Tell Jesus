    <lyrics>[V1]
 I must tell Jesus all of my trials,
 I cannot bear these burdens alone;
 In my distress He kindly will help me,
 He ever loves and cares for His own.
 
[C]
 I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
 I cannot bear my burdens alone;
 I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
 Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.
 
[V2]
 I must tell Jesus all of my troubles,
 He is a kind, compassionate Friend;
 If I but ask Him He will deliver,
 Make of my troubles quickly an end.
 
[V3]
 Oh, how the world to evil allures me!
 Oh, how my heart is tempted to sin!
 I must tell Jesus, and He will help me
 Over the world the victâ€™ry to win.</lyrics>
