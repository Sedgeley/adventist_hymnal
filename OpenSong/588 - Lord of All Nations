    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord of all nations, grant me grace
 To love all people, every race,
 And in each person may I see
 My kindred loved, redeemed by Thee.
 
[V2]
 Break down the wall that would divide
 Thy children, Lord, on every side.
 My neighbor’s good let me pursue;
 Let Christian love bind warm and true.
 
[V3]
 Forgive me, Lord, where I have erred
 By loveless act and thoughtless word.
 Make me to see the wrong I do
 Will crucify my Lord anew.
 
[V4]
 Give me Thy courage, Lord, to speak
 Whenever strong oppress the weak.
 Should I myself the victim be,
 Help me forgive, remembering Thee.
 
[V5]
 With Thine own love may I be filled
 And by Thy Holy Spirit willed,
 That all I touch, where’er I be,
 May be divinely touched by Thee.</lyrics>
