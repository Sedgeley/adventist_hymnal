    <lyrics>[V1]
 I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
 He loved me ere I knew Him;
 He drew me with the cords of love,
 And thus He bound me to Him.
 And ’round my heart still closely twine
 Those ties which nought can sever,
 For I am His, and He is mine,
 Forever and forever.
 
[V2]
 I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
 He bled, He died to save me;
 And not alone the gift of life,
 But His own self He gave me.
 Nought that I have my own I call,
 I hold it for the Giver;
 My heart, my strength, my life my all,
 Are His, and His forever.
 
[V3]
 I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
 All power to Him is given;
 To guard me on my upward course,
 And bring me safe to heaven.
 The eternal glories gleam afar,
 To nerve my faint endeavor;
 So now to watch, to work, to war,
 And then to rest forever.
 
[V4]
 I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
 So kind, and true, and tender,
 So wise a counselor and guide,
 So mighty a defender.
 From Him, who loveth me so well,
 What power my soul can sever?
 Shall life or death, or earth, or hell?
 No; I am His forever.</lyrics>
