    <lyrics>[V1]
 My hope is built on nothing less
 than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
 but wholly lean on Jesus’ name.
 
[C]
 On Christ the solid rock I stand;
 all other ground is sinking sand,
 all other ground is sinking sand.
 
[V2]
 When Darkness veils his lovely face,
 I rest on his unchanging grace.
 in every high and stormy gale,
 my anchor holds within the veil.
 
[V3]
 His oath, his covenant, his blood
 supports me in the whelming flood.
 When all around my soul gives way,
 he then is all my hope and stay.
 
[V4]
 When He shall come with trumpet sound,
 O may I then in him be found!
 Dressed in his righteousness alone,
 faultless to stand before the throne.</lyrics>
