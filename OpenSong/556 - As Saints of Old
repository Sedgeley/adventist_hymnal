    <lyrics>[V1]
 As saints of old their first fruits brought
 Of orchard, flock, and field
 To God the giver all good,
 The source of bounteous yield;
 So we today first fruits would bring:
 The wealth of this good land,
 Of farm and market, shop and home,
 Of mind, and heart, and hand.
 
[V2]
 A world in need now summons us
 To labor, love, and give;
 To make our life an offering
 To God, that all may live.
 The Church of Christ is calling us
 To make the dream come true:
 A world redeemed by Christ-like love;
 All life in Christ made new.
 
[V3]
 In gratitude and humble trust
 We bring our best today,
 To serve Your cause and share Your love
 With all along life’s way.
 O God, who gave yourself to us
 In Jesus Christ Your Son,
 Teach us to give ourselves each day
 Until life’s work is done.</lyrics>
