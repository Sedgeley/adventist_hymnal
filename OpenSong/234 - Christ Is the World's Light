    <lyrics>[V1]
 Christ is the world’s light,
 Christ and none other;
 born in our darkness,
 He became our brother
 if we have seen Him,
 we have seen the Father:
 Glory to God on high!
 
[V2]
 Christ is the world’s peace,
 Christ and none other;
 no one can serve Him,
 and despise another.
 Who else unites us,
 one in God the Father?
 Glory to God on high!
 
[V3]
 Christ is the world’s life,
 Christ and none other;
 sold once for silver,
 murdered here, our brother
 He, who redeems us,
 reigns with God the Father:
 Glory to God on high!
 
[V4]
 Give God the glory,
 God and none other;
 give God the glory,
 Spirit, Son and Father;
 give God the glory,
 God-with-us our brother:
 Glory to God on high!</lyrics>
