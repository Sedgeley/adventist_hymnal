    <lyrics>[V1]
 For all the saints
 who from their labors rest,
 Who thee by faith
 before the world confessed.
 Thy name, O Jesus,
 be forever blest.
 Alleluia!
 Alleluia!
 
[V2]
 Thou wast their Rock,
 their Fortress and their Might;
 Thou, Lord, their captain
 in the well-fought fight;
 Thou, in the darkness drear,
 their one true light.
 Alleluia!
 Alleluia!
 
[V3]
 O may Thy soldiers,
 faithful, true, and bold,
 Fight as the saints
 who nobly fought of old,
 And win with them
 the victor’s crown of gold.
 Alleluia!
 Alleluia!
 
[V4]
 And when the strife is fierce,
 the warfare long,
 Steals on the ear
 the distant triumph song,
 And hearts are brave again,
 and arms are strong.
 Alleluia!
 Alleluia!
 
[V5]
 From earth’s wide bounds,
 from ocean’s farthest coast,
 Thro’ gates of pearl
 streams in the countless host,
 Singing to Father,
 Son, and Holy Ghost,
 Alleluia!
 Alleluia!</lyrics>
