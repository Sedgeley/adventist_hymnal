    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee,
 These children dear of mine, Thou gavest me;
 O, by Thy love divine, Lead them, my God, to Thee;
 Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
 
[V2]
 When earth looks bright and fair, Festive and gay,
 Let no delusive snare Lure them astray;
 But from temptation’s power, Lead them, my God, to Thee,
 Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
 
[V3]
 E’en for such little ones, Christ came a child,
 And in this world of sin Lived undefiled.
 O, for His sake, I pray, Lead them, my God, to Thee,
 Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
 
[V4]
 Yea, though my faith be dim, I would believe
 That Thou this precious gift Wilt now receive;
 O take their young hearts now, Lead them my God to Thee,
 Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.</lyrics>
