    <lyrics>[V1]
 As pants the hart for cooling streams
 When heated in the chase,
 So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
 And Thy refreshing grace.
 
[V2]
 For Thee, my God, the living God,
 My thirsty soul doth pine:
 O when shall I behold Thy face,
 Thou Majesty divine?
 
[V3]
 Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
 Hope still, and thou shalt sing
 The praise of Him who is thy God,
 Thy healthâ€™s eternal spring.
 
[V4]
 To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
 The God whom we adore,
 Be glory, as it was, is now,
 And shall be evermore.</lyrics>
