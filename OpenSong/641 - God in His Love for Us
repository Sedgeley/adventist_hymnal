    <lyrics>[V1]
 God in His love for us lent us this planet,
 Gave it a purpose in time and in space:
 Small as a spark from the fire of creation,
 Cradle of life and the home of our race.
 
[V2]
 Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,
 Life that sustains us in body and mind:
 Plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,
 Riches undreamed of to fathom and find.
 
[V3]
 Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;
 Long has earth bowed to the terror of forced;
 Long have we wasted what others have need of,
 Poisoned the fountain of life at its source.
 
[V4]
 Earth is the Lordâ€™s: it is ours to enjoy it,
 Ours, as His stewards, to farm and defend.
 From its pollution, misuse, and destruction,
 Good Lord, deliver us, world without end!</lyrics>
