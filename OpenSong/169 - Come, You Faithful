    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, you faithful, raise the strain
 Of triumphant gladness;
 God has brought His people
 Now rejoice, Jerusalem,
 And with true affection
 Welcome in unwearied strains
 Jesus’resurrection.
 
[V2]
 ‘Tis the spring of souls today;
 Christ has burst His prison
 From the frost and gloom of death
 light and life have risen
 All the winter of our sins,
 Long and dark, is flying
 From His ligth, to whom we give
 Thanks and praise undying.
 
[V3]
 “Alleluia!” now we cry
 to our King immortal,
 Who, triumphant, burst the
 bars of the tomb’s dark portal
 “Alleluia!” with the Son,
 God the Father praising;
 “Alleluia!” yet again to
 the Spirit raising.</lyrics>
