    <lyrics>[V1]
 The King of love my Shepherd is,
 Whose goodness faileth never;
 I nothing lack if I am His,
 And He is mine forever.
 
[V2]
 Where streams of living water flow
 My ransomed soul He leadeth,
 And, where the verdant pastures grow,
 With food celestial feedeth.
 
[V3]
 Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
 But yet in love He sought me,
 And on His shoulder gently laid,
 And home, rejoicing, brought me.
 
[V4]
 And so through all the length of days
 Thy goodness faileth never;
 Good Shepherd! I would sing Thy praise
 Within Thy house forever.</lyrics>
