    <lyrics>[V1]
 Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
 that saved a wretch like me!
 I once was lost, but now am found;
 was blind, but now I see.
 
[V2]
 ‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
 and grace my fears relieved;
 how precious did that grace appear
 the hour I first believed.
 
[V3]
 The Lord has promised good to me,
 his word my hope secures;
 he will my shield and portion be,
 as long as life endures.
 
[V4]
 Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
 I have already come;
 ’tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
 and grace will lead me home.
 
[V5]
 When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
 bright shining as the sun,
 we’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
 than when we first begun.</lyrics>
