    <lyrics>[V1]
 There is a balm in Gilead
 To make the wounded whole;
 There is a balm in Gilead
 To heal the sin-sick soul.
 
[V2]
 Sometimes I feel discouraged,
 And think my workâ€™s in vain,
 But then the Holy Spirit
 Revives my soul again.
 
[V3]
 If you can not preach like Peter,
 If you can not pray like Paul,
 You can tell the love of Jesus,
 And say He died for all.</lyrics>
