    <lyrics>[V1]
 
[C]
 Go, tell it on the mountain,
 Over the hills and everywhere:
 Go, tell it on the mountain
 That Jesus Christ is born!
 
[V1]
 While shepherds kept their watching
 O’er silent flocks by night,
 Behold throughout the heavens
 There shone a holy light.
 
[V2]
 The shepherds feared and trembled
 When lo! Above the earth
 Rang out the angel chorus
 That hailed our Savior’s birth.
 
[V3]
 Down in a lowly manger
 The humble Christ was born,
 And brought us God’s salvation
 That blessed Christmas morn.</lyrics>
