    <lyrics>[V1]
 Alas! and did my Savior bleed,
 and did my Sovereign die?
 Would he devote that sacred head
 for sinners such as I?
 
[C]
 At the cross, at the cross,
 where I first saw the light,
 and the burden of my heart rolled away;
 it was there by faith I received my sight,
 and now I am happy all the day!
 
[V2]
 Was it for crimes that I have done,
 he groaned upon the tree?
 Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
 And love beyond degree!
 
[V3]
 But drops of grief can ne’er repay
 the debt of love I owe:
 Here, Lord, I give myself away;
 ’tis all that I can do!</lyrics>
