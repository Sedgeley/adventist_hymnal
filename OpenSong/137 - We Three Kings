    <lyrics>[V1]
 We three kings of Orient are;
 Bearing gifts we traverse afar
 Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
 Following yonder star.
 
[C]
 O star of wonder, star of night,
 Star with royal beauty bright,
 Westward leading, still proceeding,
 Guide us to Thy perfect light.
 
[V2]
 Born a King on Bethlehemâ€™s plain,
 Gold I bring to crown Him again,
 King forever, ceasing never
 Over us all to reign.
 
[V3]
 Frankincense to offer have I;
 Incense owns a Deity nigh;
 Prayer and praising all men raising,
 Worship Him, God on high.
 
[V4]
 Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume
 Breathes a life of gathering gloom:
 Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
 Sealed in the stonecold tomb.
 
[V5]
 Glorious now behold Him arise,
 King and God and sacrifice;
 Alleluia, Alleluia!
 Sounds through the earth and skies.</lyrics>
