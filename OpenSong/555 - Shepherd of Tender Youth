    <lyrics>[V1]
 Shepherd of tender you,
 Guiding in love and truth,
 Through devious way;
 Christ our triumphant King,
 We come Thy name to sin,
 Hither our children bring
 To shout Thy praise.
 
[V2]
 Thou are our holy Lord,
 Thee all subduing Word,
 Healer of strife;
 Thou didst Thyself abase,
 That from sinâ€™s deep disgrace
 Thou mightest save our race,
 And give us life.
 
[V3]
 Thou are the great High Priest;
 Thou has prepared the feast
 Of heavenly love;
 While in our mortal pain
 None call on Thee in vain;
 Help Thou does not disdain,
 Help from above.
 
[V4]
 Ever be Thou our Guide,
 Our Shepherd and our pride,
 Our staff and song;
 Jesus, Thou Christ of God,
 By Thy perennial word,
 Lead us where Thou hast trod,
 Make our faith strong.</lyrics>
