    <lyrics>[V1]
 Praise we the Lord, who made all beauty
 For all our senses to enjoy;
 Owe we our humble thanks and duty
 That simple pleasures never cloy;
 Praise we the Lord, who made all beauty
 For all our senses to enjoy.
 
[V2]
 Praise Him who loves to see young lovers,
 Fresh hearts that swell with youthful pride;
 Thank Him who sends the sun above us,
 As bridegroom fit to meet his bride;
 Praise Him who loves to see young lovers,
 Fresh hearts that swell with youthful pride.
 
[V3]
 Praise Him who by a simple flower
 Lifts up our hearts to things above;
 Thank Him who gives to each one power
 To find a friend to know and love;
 Praise Him who by a simple flower
 Lifts up our hearts to things above.</lyrics>
