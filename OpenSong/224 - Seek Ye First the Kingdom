    <lyrics>[V1]
 Seek ye first the kingdom,
 ‘Tis your Father’s will.
 So the voice of Jesus
 bids us follow still.
 Savior, we would hear Thee,
 Follow, find, and see;
 And in life’s adventure
 Thy disciples be.
 
[V2]
 As for hidden treasure,
 Or for matchless pearl,
 When at last discovered,
 some will sell their all;
 So, when breaks the vision
 of that kingdom fair,
 Ours shall be its riches
 And its beauty rare.
 
[V3]
 As the silent leaven
 works its secret way,
 Or as grows the seed grain
 through the night and day;
 Lord, so be the increase,
 peaceable but sure,
 Of Thy word within us,
 And Thy kingdom’s power.
 
[V4]
 As the tender seedling
 grows up tall and strong,
 And the birds of heaven
 to its branches throng;
 So shall all God’s children,
 from the east and west,
 Gather to His kingdom,
 In its shadow rest.
 
[V5]
 Humblest shall be greatest,
 poor in spirit reign;
 Home shall come the childlike,
 born through Thee again;
 Eager hearts arrive there
 on the pilgrim’s road,
 Hail! The kingdom glorious
 of the living God!</lyrics>
