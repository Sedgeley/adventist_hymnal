    <lyrics>[V1]
 Live out Thy life within me,
 O Jesus, King of kings!
 Be Thou Thyself the answer
 To all my questionings;
 Live out Thy life within me,
 In all things have Thy way!
 I, the transparent medium
 Thy glory to display.
 
[V2]
 The temple has been yielded,
 And purified of sin;
 Let Thy Shekinah glory
 Now shine forth from within,
 And all the earth keep silence,
 The body henceforth be
 Thy silent, gentle servant,
 Moved only as by Thee.
 
[V3]
 Its members every moment
 Held subject to Thy call,
 Ready to have Thee use them,
 Or not be used at all;
 Held without restless longing,
 Or strain, or stress, or fret
 Or chafings at Thy dealings,
 Or thoughts of vain regret.
 
[V4]
 But restful, calm, and pliant,
 From bend and bias free,
 Awaiting Thy decision,
 When Thou hast need of me.
 Live out Thy life within me,
 O Jesus, King of kings!
 Be Thou the glorious answer
 To all my questionings.</lyrics>
