    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord Jesus, think on me,
 And purge away my sin;
 From earth-born passions set me free,
 And make me pure within.
 
[V2]
 Lord Jesus, think on me,
 With care and woe oppressed;
 Let me Thy loving servant be,
 And taste Thy promised rest.
 
[V3]
 Lord Jesus, think on me,
 Nor let me go astray;
 Through darkness and perplexity
 Point Thou the heavenly way.
 
[V4]
 Lord Jesus, think on me,
 That I may sing above
 To Father, Spirit, and to Thee,
 The strains of praise and love.</lyrics>
