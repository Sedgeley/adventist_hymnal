    <lyrics>[V1]
 When morning gilds the skies
 my heart awaking cries,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Alike at work and prayer,
 to Jesus I repair:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 
[V2]
 Whene’er the sweet church bell
 peals over hill and dell,
 May Jesus Christ praised!
 O hark to what it sings,
 as joyously it rings,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 
[V3]
 The night becomes as day
 when from the heart we say:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 The powers of darkness fear
 when this sweet chant they hear:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 
[V4]
 Ye nations of mankind,
 in this your concord find,
 May Jesus Christ praised!
 Let all the earth around
 ring joyous with the sound,
 May Jesus Christ praised!
 
[V5]
 In heaven’s eternal bliss
 the loveliest strain is this,
 May Jesus Christ praised!
 Let earth, and sea and sky
 from depth to height reply,
 May Jesus Christ praised!
 
[V6]
 Be this, while life is mine,
 my canticle divine:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Be this th’eternal song
 through all the ages long,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!</lyrics>
