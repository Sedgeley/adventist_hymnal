    <lyrics>[V1]
 Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
 
[V1]
 The strife is o’er, the battle done;
 Now is the victor’s triumph won!
 Now be the song of praise begun. Alleluia!
 
[V2]
 The pow’rs of death have done their worst,
 But Christ their legions has dispersed.
 Let shouts of holy joy outburst. Alleluia!
 
[V3]
 The three sad days have quickly sped,
 He rises glorious from the dead.
 All glory to our risen head! Alleluia!
 
[V4]
 Lord, by the stripes which wounded You,
 From death’s sting free Your servants too,
 That we may live and sing to You. Alleluia!</lyrics>
