    <lyrics>[V1]
 We plow the fields, and scatter
 the good seed on the land,
 But it is fed and watered
 by Godâ€™s almighty hand.
 He sends the snow in winter,
 the warmth to swell the grain,
 The breezes and the sunshine,
 and soft refreshing rain.
 
[C]
 All good gifts around us
 Are sent from heaven above;
 Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord
 For all His love.
 
[V2]
 He only is the Maker
 of all things near and far;
 He paints the wayside flower,
 He lights the evening star.
 The winds and waves obey Him,
 by Him the birds are fed;
 Much more, to us His children,
 He gives our daily bread.
 
[V3]
 We thank Thee then, O Father,
 for all things bright and good,
 The seed-time and the harvest,
 our life, our health, and food.
 Accept the gifts we to offer
 for all Thy love imparts,
 And, what Thou most desirest,
 our humble, thankful hearts.</lyrics>
