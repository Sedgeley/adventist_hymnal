    <lyrics>[V1]
 I love to tell the story
 of unseen things above,
 of Jesus and his glory,
 of Jesus and his love.
 I love to tell the story,
 because I know ’tis true;
 it satisfies my longings
 as nothing else can do.
 
[C]
 I love to tell the story,
 ’twill be my theme in glory,
 to tell the old, old story
 of Jesus and his love.
 
[V2]
 I love to tell the story;
 more wonderful it seems
 than all the golden fancies
 of all our golden dreams.
 I love to tell the story,
 it did so much for me;
 and that is just the reason
 I tell it now to thee.
 
[V3]
 I love to tell the story;
 ’tis pleasant to repeat
 what seems, each time I tell it,
 more wonderfully sweet.
 I love to tell the story,
 for some have never heard
 the message of salvation
 from God’s own holy Word.
 
[V4]
 I love to tell the story,
 for those who know it best
 seem hungering and thirsting
 to hear it like the rest.
 And when, in scenes of glory,
 I sing the new, new song,
 ’twill be the old, old story
 that I have loved so long.</lyrics>
