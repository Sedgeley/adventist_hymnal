    <lyrics>[V1]
 Tell out my soul, the greatness of the Lord:
 Unnumbered blessings, give my spirit voice;
 Tender to me the promise of His Word;
 In God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.
 
[V2]
 Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name:
 Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done;
 His mercy sure, from age to age the same;
 His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.
 
[V3]
 Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might:
 Pow’rs and dominions lay their glory by;
 Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,
 The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.
 
[V4]
 Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word:
 Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.
 Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord
 To children’s children and forevermore.</lyrics>
