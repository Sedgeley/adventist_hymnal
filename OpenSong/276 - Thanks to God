    <lyrics>[V1]
 Thanks to God whose Word was spoken
 In the deed that made the earth.
 His the voice that called a nation;
 His the fires that tried her worth.
 God has spoken;
 Praise Him For His open Word
 
[V2]
 Thanks to God whose Word incarnate
 Glorified the flesh of man.
 Deeds and words and death and rising
 Tell the grace in heaven’s plan.
 God has spoken;
 Praise Him For His open Word
 
[V3]
 Thanks to God whose Word is answered
 By the Spirit’s voice within.
 Here we drink of joy unmeasured,
 Life redeemed from death and sin.
 God has spoken;
 Praise Him For His open Word</lyrics>
