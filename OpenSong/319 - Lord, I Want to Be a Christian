    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, I want to be a Christian
 in my heart, in my heart,
 Lord, I want to be a Christian
 in my heart, in my heart.
 In my heart, in my heart,
 Lord, I want to be a Christian
 in my heart, in my heart.
 
[V2]
 Lord, I want to be more loving
 in my heart, in my heart,
 Lord, I want to be more loving
 in my heart, in my heart.
 In my heart, in my heart,
 Lord, I want to be more loving
 in my heart, in my heart.
 
[V3]
 Lord, I want to be more holy
 in my heart, in my heart,
 Lord, I want to be more holy
 in my heart, in my heart.
 In my heart, in my heart,
 Lord, I want to be more holy
 in my heart, in my heart.
 
[V4]
 Lord, I want to be more like Jesus
 in my heart, in my heart,
 Lord, I want to be more like Jesus
 in my heart, in my heart.
 In my heart, in my heart,
 Lord, I want to be more like Jesus
 in my heart, in my heart.</lyrics>
