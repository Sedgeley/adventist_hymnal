    <lyrics>[V1]
 God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,
 He came to love, heal, and forgive;
 He lived and died to buy my pardon,
 An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
 
[C]
 Because He lives I can face tomorrow,
 Because He lives all fear is gone;
 Because I know He holds the future.
 And life is worth the living just because He lives.
 
[V2]
 How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
 And feel the pride, and joy He gives;
 But greater still the calm assurance,
 This child can face uncertain days because He lives.</lyrics>
