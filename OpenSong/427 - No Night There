    <lyrics>[V1]
 In the land of fadeless day
 Lies “the city four-square;”
 It shall never pass away,
 And there is “no night there.”
 
[C]
 God shall “wipe away all tears;”
 There’s no death, no pain, nor fears;
 And they count not time by years,
 For there is “no night there.”
 
[V2]
 All the gates of pearl are made,
 In “the city four-square;”
 All the streets with gold are laid,
 And there is “no night there.”
 
[V3]
 And the gates shall never close
 To “the city four-square;”
 There life’s crystal river flows,
 And there is “no night there.”
 
[V4]
 There they need no sunshine bright,
 In “that city four-square;”
 For the Lamb is all the light,
 And there is “no night there.”</lyrics>
