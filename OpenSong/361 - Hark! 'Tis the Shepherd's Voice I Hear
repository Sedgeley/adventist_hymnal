    <lyrics>[V1]
 Hark! ’tis the Shepherd’s voice I hear,
 Out in the desert dark and drear,
 Calling the sheep who’ve gone astray,
 Far from the Shepherd’s fold away.
 
[C]
 Bring them in, Bring them in,
 Bring them in from the fields of sin;
 Bring them in, Bring them in,
 Bring the wanderers to Jesus.
 
[V2]
 Who’ll go and help the Shepherd kind,
 Help Him the wandering ones to find?
 Who’ll bring them back into the fold,
 Where they’ll be sheltered from the cold?
 
[V3]
 Out in the desert hear their cry,
 Out on the mountain wild and high,
 Hark! ’tis the Master speaks to thee,
 “Go, find My sheep where ‘er they be.”</lyrics>
