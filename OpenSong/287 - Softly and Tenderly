    <lyrics>[V1]
 Softly and tenderly
 Jesus is calling,
 calling for you and for me;
 see, on the portals
 heâ€™s waiting and watching,
 watching for you and for me.
 
[C]
 Come home, come home;
 ye who are weary come home;
 earnestly, tenderly,
 Jesus is calling,
 calling, O sinner,
 come home!
 
[V2]
 Why should we tary
 when Jesus is pleading,
 pleading for you and for me?
 Why should we linger
 and heed not his mercies,
 mercies for you and for me?
 
[V3]
 Think of the wonderful
 love he has promised,
 promised for you and for me!
 Though we have sinned,
 he has mercy and pardon,
 pardon for you and for me.</lyrics>
