    <lyrics>[V1]
 Now the green blade rises
 from the buried grain,
 What that in dark earth
 many days has lain;
 Love lives again,
 that with the dead has been;
 Love is come again
 like wheat arising green.
 
[V2]
 In the grave they laid Him,
 love by hatred slain,
 Thinking that He would
 never wake again,
 Laid in the earth like grain
 that sleeps unseen;
 Love is come again
 like wheat arising green.
 
[V3]
 Forth He came in triumph,
 like the risen grain,
 He that for three days
 in the grave had lain;
 Raised from the dead,
 my living Lord is seen;
 Love is come again
 like wheat arising green.
 
[V4]
 When our hearts are wintry,
 grieving, or in pain,
 Your touch can call us
 back to life again,
 Field of our hearts that dead
 and bare have been;
 Love is come again
 like wheat arising green.</lyrics>
