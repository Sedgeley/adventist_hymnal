    <lyrics>[V1]
 Holy Spirit, gracious guest,
 Hear and grant our heart’s request
 For that gift supreme and best:
 Holy heav’nly love.
 
[V2]
 Faith that mountains could remove,
 Tongues of earth or heaven above,
 Knowledge, all things, empty prove
 If I have no love.
 
[V3]
 Though I as a martyr bleed,
 Give my goods the poor to feed,
 All is vain if love I need:
 Therefore give me love.
 
[V4]
 Love is kind and suffers long,
 Love is pure and thinks no wrong,
 Love than death it self more strong:
 Therefore give us love.
 
[V5]
 Prophecy will fade away,
 Melting in the light of day;
 Love will ever with us stay:
 Therefore give us love.
 
[V6]
 Faith and hope and love we see
 Joining hand in hand agree-
 But the greatest of the three,
 And the best is love.</lyrics>
