    <lyrics>[V1]
 To the name that brings salvation
 Let the nations bow the head;
 Let them kneel in adoration
 When this name of names is said;
 Let them pray for restoration
 Of all things in Christ the head.
 
[V2]
 He through every generation
 Rules in endless majesty;
 May the kings of every nation
 Now foreswear their enmity,
 And with humble veneration
 In the love of God agree.
 
[V3]
 Lord, we pray for upright rulers:
 Guard them surely in their need
 From the vanity of power
 And the emptiness of greed;
 Let them see the truth of lowness,
 And on justice let them feed.</lyrics>
