    <lyrics>[V1]
 God who spoke in the beginning,
 Forming rock and shaping spar,
 Set all life and growth in motion,
 Earthly world and distant star;
 He who calls the earth to order
 Is the ground of what we are.
 
[V2]
 God who spoke thro’ men and nations,
 Thro’ events long past and gone,
 Showing still today His purpose,
 Speaks supremely through His Son;
 He who calls the earth to order
 Gives His word and it is done.
 
[V3]
 God whose speech becomes incarnate –
 Christ is servant, Christ is Lord –
 Calls us to a life of service,
 Heart and will to action stirred;
 He who uses man’s obedience
 Has the first and final word.</lyrics>
