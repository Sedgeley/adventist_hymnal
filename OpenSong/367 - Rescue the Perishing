    <lyrics>[V1]
 Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
 snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
 weep oâ€™er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
 tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.
 
[C]
 Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
 Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
 
[V2]
 Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,
 waiting the penitent child to receive;
 plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
 he will forgive if they only believe.
 
[V3]
 Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
 strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
 back to the narrow way patiently win them;
 tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.</lyrics>
