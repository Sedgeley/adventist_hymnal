    <lyrics>[V1]
 My song shall be of Jesus;
 His mercy crowns my days,
 He fills my cup with blessings,
 And tunes my heart to praise.
 My song shall be of Jesus,
 The precious Lamb of God,
 Who gave Himself my ransom,
 And bought me with His blood.
 
[V2]
 My song shall be of Jesus
 When, sitting at His feet,
 I call to mind His goodness
 In meditation sweet:
 My song shall be of Jesus,
 Whatever ill betide;
 I’ll sing the grace that saves me,
 And keeps me at His side.
 
[V3]
 My song shall be of Jesus
 While pressing on my way
 To reach the blissful kingdom
 Of pure and perfect day:
 And when my soul shall enter
 That realm of splendor fair,
 A song of praise to Jesus
 I’ll sing forever there.</lyrics>
