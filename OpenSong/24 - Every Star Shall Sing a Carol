    <lyrics>[V1]
 Every star shall sing a carol;
 Every creatures, high or low,
 Come and praise the King of heaven
 By whatever name you know.
 God above, Man below,
 Holy is the name I know.
 
[V2]
 When the King of all creation
 Had a cradle on the earth,
 Holy was the human body,
 Holy was the human birth.
 God above, Man below,
 Holy is the name I know.
 
[V3]
 Every star and every planet,
 Every creature, high or low,
 Come and praise the King of heaven
 By whatever name you know.
 God above, Man below,
 Holy is the name I know.</lyrics>
