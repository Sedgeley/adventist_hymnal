    <lyrics>[V1]
 Look for the way-marks as you journey on,
 Look for the way-marks passing one by one;
 Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four—
 Where are we standing? Look the way-marks o’er.
 
[C]
 Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,
 Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.
 Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic way-marks;
 The journey’s almost o’er.
 
[V2]
 First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,
 Then Medo-Persia’s banners were unfurled;
 And after Greece held universal sway,
 Rome seized the scepter—where are we today?
 
[V3]
 Down in the feet of iron and of clay,
 Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
 What will the next great, glorious drama be?
 Christ and His coming, and eternity.</lyrics>
