    <lyrics>[V1]
 Thine is the glory,
 Risen, conquering Son;
 Endless is the victory
 thou o’er death hast won.
 Angels in bright raiment
 rolled the stone away,
 Kept the folded grave-clothes
 where Thy body lay.
 
[C]
 Thine is the glory,
 Risen, conquering Son;
 Endless is the victory
 Thou o’er death hast won.
 
[V2]
 Lo! Jesus meets us.
 Risen from the tomb,
 Lovingly He greets us,
 Scatters fear and gloom;
 Let His Church with gladness
 hymns of triumph sing,
 For her Lord now liveth;
 Death has lost its sting.
 
[V3]
 No more we doubt Thee,
 Glorious Prince of life!
 Life is nought without Thee;
 Aid us in our strife;
 Make us more than conquerors
 through Thy deathless love
 Bring us safe through Jordan
 to Thy home above.</lyrics>
