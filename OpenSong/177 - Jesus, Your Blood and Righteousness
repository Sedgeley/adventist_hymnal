    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, your blood and righteousness
 My beauty are, my glorious dress;
 Mid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
 With joy shall I lift up my head.
 
[V2]
 Bold shall I stand in that great day,
 Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;
 For by your cross absolved I am
 From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.
 
[V3]
 Lord, I believe your precious blood,
 Which at the mercy seat of God
 Pleads for the captivesâ€™ liberty,
 Was also shed in love for me.
 
[V4]
 When from the dust of death I rise
 To claim my mansion in the skies,
 This then shall be my only plea:
 Christ Jesus lived and died for me.</lyrics>
