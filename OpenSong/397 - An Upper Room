    <lyrics>[V1]
 An upper room did our Lord prepare
 For those loved until the end:
 And His disciples still gather there,
 To celebrate their risen Friend.
 
[V2]
 And after supper He washed their feet,
 For service, too, is sacrament.
 In Him our joy shall be made complete
 Sent out to serve, as He was sent.
 
[V3]
 A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:
 To share His bread, His loving cup.
 Whatever burdens may bow us down,
 He by His cross shall lift us up.
 
[V4]
 No end there is! we depart in peace.
 He loves beyond our uttermost:
 In every room in our Fatherâ€™s house,
 He will be there, as Lord and host.</lyrics>
