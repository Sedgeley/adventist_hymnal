    <lyrics>[V1]
 Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way,
 In a little while we’re going home.
 For the night will end in the everlasting day,
 In a little while we’re going home.
 
[C]
 In a little while, In a little while,
 We shall cross the billow’s foam;
 We shall meet at last, When the stormy winds are past,
 In a little while we’re going home.
 
[V2]
 We will do the work that our hands may find to do,
 In a little while we’re going home.
 And the grace of God will our daily strength renew,
 In a little while we’re going home.
 
[V3]
 We will smooth the path for some weary, wayworn feet,
 In a little while we’re going home.
 And may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!
 In a little while we’re going home.
 
[V4]
 There’s a rest beyond, there’s relief from every care,
 In a little while we’re going home;
 And no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair,
 In a little while we’re going home.</lyrics>
