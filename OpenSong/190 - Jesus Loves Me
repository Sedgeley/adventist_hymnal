    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus loves me! this I know,
 For the Bible tells me so;
 Little ones to Him belong
 They are weak but He is strong
 
[C]
 Yes, Jesus loves me!
 Yes, Jesus loves me!
 Yes, Jesus loves me!
 The Bible tells me so.
 
[V2]
 Jesus loves me! He wo died
 Heavenâ€™s gate to open wide:
 He will wash away my sin,
 Let His little child come in.
 
[V3]
 Jesus, take this heart of mine,
 Make it pure and wholly thine;
 On the coross You died for me,
 I will love and live for Thee.</lyrics>
