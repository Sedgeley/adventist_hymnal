    <lyrics>[V1]
 Away in a manger,
 no crib for a bed,
 The little Lord Jesus
 laid down his sweet head.
 The stars in the sky
 looked down where he lay,
 The little Lord Jesus
 asleep in the hay.
 
[V2]
 The cattle are lowing,
 the baby awakes,
 But little Lord Jesus
 no crying he makes.
 I love Thee, Lord Jesus,
 look down from the sky
 And stay by my cradle
 til morning is nigh.
 
[V3]
 Be near me, Lord Jesus,
 I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever,
 and love me, I pray.
 Bless all the dear children
 in thy tender care,
 And take us to heaven,
 to live with Thee there.</lyrics>
