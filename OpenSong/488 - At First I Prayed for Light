    <lyrics>[V1]
 At first I prayed for light:
 Could I but see the way,
 How gladly, swiftly would I walk
 To everlasting day!
 
[V2]
 And next I prayed for strength:
 That I might tread the road
 With firm, unfaltering feet, and win
 The heaven’s serene abode.
 
[V3]
 And then I asked for faith:
 Could I but trust my God,
 I’d live infolded in His peace,
 Though foes were all abroad.
 
[V4]
 But now I pray for love:
 Deep love to God and man;
 A living love that will not fail,
 However dark His plan.
 
[V5]
 And light and strength and faith
 Are opening everywhere!
 God waited patiently until
 I prayed the larger prayer.</lyrics>
