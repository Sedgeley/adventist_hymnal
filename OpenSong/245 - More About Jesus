    <lyrics>[V1]
 More about Jesus, I would know,
 More of His grace to others show;
 More of His saving fullness see,
 More of His love who died for me.
 
[C]
 More, more about Jesus,
 More, more about Jesus;
 More of His saving fullness see,
 More of His love who died for me.
 
[V2]
 More about Jesus, let me learn,
 More of His holy will discern;
 Spirit of God, my teacher be,
 Showing the things of Christ to me.
 
[V3]
 More about Jesus, in His word,
 Holding communion with my Lord;
 Hearing His voice in every line,
 Making each faithful saying mine.
 
[V4]
 More about Jesus, on His throne,
 Riches in glory all His own;
 More of His kingdomâ€™s sure increase,
 More of His coming, Prince of Peace.</lyrics>
