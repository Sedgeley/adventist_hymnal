    <lyrics>[V1]
 Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;
 To his feet thy tribute bring;
 Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
 Who like thee His praise should sing?
 Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!
 Praise the everlasting King.
 
[V2]
 Praise him for his grace and favor
 To our fathers in distress;
 Praise him still the same forever,
 Slow to chide and swift to bless:
 Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!
 Glorious in His faithfulness.
 
[V3]
 Tenderly He shields and spares us;
 Well our feeble frame he knows;
 In his hands He gently bears us,
 Rescues us from all our foes.
 Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!
 Widely yet his mercy flows.
 
[V4]
 Angels, help us to adore him;
 Ye behold him face to face;
 Sun and moon, bow down before him,
 Dwellers all in time and space.
 Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!
 Praise with us the God of grace.</lyrics>
