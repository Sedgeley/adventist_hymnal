    <lyrics>[V1]
 Angels from the realms of glory,
 Wing your flight o`er all the earth;
 Ye, who sang creation`s story,
 Now proclaim Messiah`s birth;
 Come and worship, Come and worship,
 Worship Christ, the newborn King.
 
[V2]
 Shepherds, in the field abiding,
 Watching o`er your flocks by night,
 God with man is now residing;
 Yonder shines the Infant Light;
 Come and worship, Come and worship,
 Worship Christ, the newborn King.
 
[V3]
 Sages, leave your contemplations,
 Brighter visions beam afar;
 Seek the great Desire of nations;
 Ye have seen His natal star;
 Come and worship, Come and worship,
 Worship Christ, the newborn King.
 
[V4]
 Saints, before the altar bending,
 Watching long in hope and fear,
 Suddenly the Lord, descending,
 In His temple shall appear;
 Come and worship, Come and worship,
 Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lyrics>
