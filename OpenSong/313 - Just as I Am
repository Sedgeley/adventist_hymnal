    <lyrics>[V1]
 Just as I am, without one plea,
 But that Thy blood was shed for me,
 And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V2]
 Just as I am, and waiting not
 To rid my soul of one dark blot,
 To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V3]
 Just as I am, though tossed about
 With many a conflict, many a doubt,
 “Fightings within, and fears without,”
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V4]
 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
 Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
 Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V5]
 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
 Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
 Because Thy promise I believe,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
 
[V6]
 Just as I am, Thy love I own
 Has broken every barrier down;
 Now, to be Thine, and Thine alone,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</lyrics>
