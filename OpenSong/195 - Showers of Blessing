    <lyrics>[V1]
 “There shall be showers of blessing;”
 This is the promise of love;
 There shall be seasons refreshing,
 Sent from the Savior above.
 
[C]
 Showers of blessing,
 Showers of blessing we need;
 Mercy drops round us are falling,
 But for the showers we plead.
 
[V2]
 “There shall be showers of blessing;”
 Precious reviving again;
 Over the hills and the valleys,
 Sound of abundance of rain.
 
[V3]
 “There shall be showers of blessing;”
 Send them upon us, O Lord;
 Grant to us now a refreshing;
 Come, and now honor Thy word.
 
[V4]
 “There shall be showers of blessing;”
 O that today they might fall,
 Now as to God were confessing,
 Now as on Jesus we call!</lyrics>
