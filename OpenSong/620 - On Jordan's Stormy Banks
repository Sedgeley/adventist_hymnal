    <lyrics>[V1]
 On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
 And cast a wishful eye
 To Canaan’s fair and happy land,
 Where my possessions lie.
 I am bound for the promised land,
 I am bound for the promised land;
 O who will come and go with me?
 I am bound for the promised land.
 
[V2]
 O’er all those wide extended plain
 Shines one eternal day;
 There, Christ, the Sun, for ever reigns,
 And scatters night away.
 I am bound for the promised land,
 I am bound for the promised land;
 O who will come and go with me?
 I am bound for the promised land.
 
[V3]
 When shall I reach that happy place,
 And be forever blest?
 When shall I see my Father’s face,
 And in His kingdom rest?
 I am bound for the promised land,
 I am bound for the promised land;
 O who will come and go with me?
 I am bound for the promised land.
 
[V4]
 Filled with delight, my raptured soul
 Would here no longer stay;
 Though Jordan’s waves around me roll,
 Fearless I’d launch away.
 I am bound for the promised land,
 I am bound for the promised land;
 O who will come and go with me?
 I am bound for the promised land.</lyrics>
