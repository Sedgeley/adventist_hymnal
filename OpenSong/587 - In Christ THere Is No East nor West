    <lyrics>[V1]
 In Christ there is no east nor west,
 In Him no south or north;
 But one great fellowship of love
 Throughout the whole wide earth.
 
[V2]
 In Him shall true heart everywhere
 Their high communion find;
 His service is the golden cord
 Close binding all mankind.
 
[V3]
 Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,
 Whateâ€™er your race may be.
 Who serves my Father as a son
 Is surely kin to me.
 
[V4]
 In Christ now meet both east and west,
 In Him meet south and north;
 All Christly souls are one in Him
 Throughout the whole wide earth.</lyrics>
