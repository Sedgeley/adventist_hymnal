    <lyrics>[V1]
 All who love and serve your city,
 All who bear its daily stress,
 All who cry for peace and justice,
 All who curse and all who bless.
 
[V2]
 In your day of loss and sorrow,
 In your day of helpless strife,
 Honor, peace, and love retreating,
 Seek the Lord, who is your life.
 
[V3]
 For all days are days of judgment,
 And the Lord is waiting still,
 Drawing near His friends who spurn Him,
 Off’ring peace from Calv’ry’s hill.
 
[V4]
 Risen Lord, shall yet the city
 Be the city of despair?
 Come today, our judge, our glory;
 Be its name “The Lord is there!”</lyrics>
