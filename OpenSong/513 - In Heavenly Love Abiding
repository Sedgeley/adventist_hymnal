    <lyrics>[V1]
 In heavenly love abiding,
 No change my heart shall fear;
 And safe is such confiding,
 For nothing changes here.
 The storm may roar without me,
 My heart may low be laid;
 But God is round about me,
 And can I be dismayed?
 
[V2]
 Wherever He may guide me,
 No want shall turn me back;
 My Shepherd is besided me,
 And nothing can I lack.
 His wisdom ever waketh,
 His sight is never dim;
 He knows the way He taketh,
 And I will walk with Him.
 
[V3]
 Green pastures are before me,
 Which yet I have not seen;
 Bright skies will soon be oâ€™er me,
 Where darkest clouds have been.
 My hope I cannot measure,
 My path to life is free;
 My Savior has my teasure,
 And He will walk with me.</lyrics>
