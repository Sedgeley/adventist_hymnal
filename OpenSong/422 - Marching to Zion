    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, we that love the Lord,
 And let our joys be known;
 Join in a song with sweet accord,
 Join in a song with sweet accord,
 And thus surround the throne,
 And thus surround the throne.
 
[C]
 We’re marching to Zion,
 Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
 We’re marching upward to Zion,
 The beautiful city of God.
 
[V2]
 Let those refuse to sing
 Who never knew our God;
 But children of the heavenly King,
 But children of the heavenly King
 May speak their joys abroad,
 May speak their joys abroad.
 
[V3]
 The hill of Zion yields
 A thousand sacred sweets
 Before we reach the heavenly fields,
 Before we reach the heavenly fields
 Or walk the golden streets,
 Or walk the golden streets.
 
[V4]
 Then let our songs abound
 And every tear be dry;
 We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
 We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground
 To fairer worlds on high,
 To fairer worlds on high.</lyrics>
