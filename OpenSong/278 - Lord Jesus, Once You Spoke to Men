    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord Jesus, once You spoke to men
 Upon the mountain and the plain,
 O help us listen now as then
 And wonder at Your words again.
 
[V2]
 We all have secret fears to face,
 Our minds and motives to amend.
 We seek Your truth,
 We need your grace,
 Our living Lord and present friend.
 
[V3]
 The gospel speaks; and we receive
 Your light, Your love,
 Your own command.
 O help us live what we believe,
 In daily word of heart and hand.</lyrics>
