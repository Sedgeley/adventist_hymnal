    <lyrics>[V1]
 Saviour, teach me day by day,
 Love’s sweet lesson to obey,
 Sweeter lesson cannot be,
 Loving Him who first loved me.
 
[V2]
 With a child’s glad heart of love,
 At Thy bidding may I move,
 Prompt to serve and follow Thee,
 Loving Him who first loved me.
 
[V3]
 Teach me I am not my own,
 I am Thine, and Thine alone;
 Thine to keep, to rule, to save
 From all sin that would enslave.
 
[V4]
 Love in loving finds employ,
 In obedience all her joy;
 Ever new that joy will be,
 Loving Him who first loved me.
 
[V5]
 Teach me thus Thy steps to trace,
 Strong to follow in Thy grace.
 Learning how to love from Thee,
 Loving Him who first loved me.</lyrics>
