    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, lover of my soul,
 let me to Thy bosom fly,
 While the nearer waters roll,
 while the tempest still is high.
 Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
 till the storm of life is past;
 Safe into the haven guide;
 O receive my soul at last.
 
[V2]
 Other refuge have I none,
 hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
 Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
 still support and comfort me.
 All my trust on Thee is stayed,
 all my help from Thee I bring;
 Cover my defenseless head
 with the shadow of Thy wing.
 
[V3]
 Thou, O Christ, art all I want,
 more than all in Thee I find;
 Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
 heal the sick, and lead the blind.
 Just and holy is Thy Name,
 I am all unrighteousness;
 False and full of sin I am;
 Thou art full of truth and grace.
 
[V4]
 Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
 grace to cover all my sin;
 Let the healing streams abound;
 make and keep me pure within.
 Thou of life the fountain art,
 freely let me take of Thee;
 Spring Thou up within my heart;
 rise to all eternity.</lyrics>
