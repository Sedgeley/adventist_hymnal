    <lyrics>[V1]
 O day of rest and gladness,
 O day of joy and light,
 O balm of care and sadness,
 Most beautiful, most bright,
 On thee the high and lowly
 Before th’ eternal throne
 Sing, “Holy, holy, holy,”
 To the great Three in One.
 
[V2]
 Thou art a port protected
 From storms that round us rise;
 A garden intersected
 With streams of paradise;
 Thou art a cooling fountain
 In life’s dry dreary sand;
 From Thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,
 We view our promised land.
 
[V3]
 A day of sweet reflection
 Thou art, a day of love,
 A day to raise affection
 From earth to things above.
 New graces ever gaining
 From this our day of rest,
 We seek the rest remaining
 To mansions of the blest.</lyrics>
