    <lyrics>[V1]
 Beneath the cross of Jesus
 I fain would take my stand,
 the shadow of a mighty rock
 within a weary land;
 a home within the wilderness,
 a rest upon the way,
 from the burning of the noontide heat,
 and the burden of the day.
 
[V2]
 Upon that cross of Jesus
 mine eye at times can see
 the very dying form of One
 who suffered there for me;
 and from my stricken heart with tears
 two wonders I confess:
 the wonders of redeeming love
 and my unworthiness.
 
[V3]
 I take, O cross, thy shadow
 for my abiding place;
 I ask no other sunshine than
 the sunshine of his face;
 content to let the world go by,
 to know no gain nor loss,
 my sinful self my only shame,
 my glory all the cross.</lyrics>
