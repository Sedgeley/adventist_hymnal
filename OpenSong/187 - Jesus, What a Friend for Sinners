    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus! what a Friend for sinners!
 Jesus! Lover of my soul;
 Friends may fail me, foes assail me,
 He, my Savior, makes me whole.
 
[C]
 Hallelujah! what a Savior!
 Hallelujah! what a Friend!
 Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
 He is with me to the end.
 
[V2]
 Jesus! what a Strength in weakness!
 Let me hide myself in Him.
 Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,
 He, my Strength, my victory wins.
 
[V3]
 Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!
 While the billows over me roll,
 Even when my heart is breaking,
 He, my Comfort, helps my soul.
 
[V4]
 Jesus! I do now receive Him,
 [or Jesus! I do now adore Him,]
 More than all in Him I find.
 He hath granted me forgiveness,
 I am His, and He is mine.</lyrics>
