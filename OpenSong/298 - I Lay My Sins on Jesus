    <lyrics>[V1]
 I lay my sins on Jesus,
 The spotless Lamb of God;
 He bears them all, and frees us
 From the accursed load,
 From the accursed load.
 
[V2]
 I bring my guilt to Jesus,
 To wash my crimson stains
 White in His blood most precious
 Till not a stain remains,
 Till not a stain remains.
 
[V3]
 I lay my wants on Jesus,
 All fullness dwells in Him;
 He healeth my diseases
 He doth my soul redeem,
 He doth my soul redeem
 
[V4]
 I long to be with Jesus,
 Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
 I long to be like Jesus
 The Father’s holy child,
 The Father’s holy child.
 
[V5]
 I long to be with Jesus
 Amid the heavenly throng,
 To sing with them His praises,
 And learn the angels’ song.
 And learn the angels’ song.</lyrics>
