    <lyrics>[V1]
 Nearer, still nearer,
 close to Thy heart,
 Draw me, my Savior,
 so precious Thou art;
 Fold me, O fold me
 close to Thy breast,
 Shelter me safe in
 that haven of rest,
 Shelter me safe in
 that haven of rest.
 
[V2]
 Nearer, still nearer,
 nothing I bring,
 Nought as an offering
 to Jesus my King-
 Only my sinful
 now contrite heart,
 Grant me the cleansing
 Thy blood doth impart,
 Grant me the cleansing
 Thy blood doth impart.
 
[V3]
 Nearer, still nearer,
 Lord, to be Thine;
 Sin, with its follies,
 I gladly resign,
 All of its pleasures,
 pomp and its pride;
 Give me but Jesus,
 my Lord crucified,
 Give me but Jesus,
 my Lord crucified.
 
[V4]
 Nearer, still nearer,
 while life shall last;
 Till safe in glory
 my anchor is cast;
 Through endless ages,
 ever to be,
 Nearer, my Savior,
 still nearer to Thee,
 Nearer, my Savior,
 still nearer to Thee.</lyrics>
