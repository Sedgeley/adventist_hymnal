    <lyrics>[V1]
 What child is this, who, laid to rest,
 On Mary`s lap is sleeping?
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
 While shepherds watch are keeping?
 
[C]
 This, this is Christ the King,
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
 The babe, the son of Mary.
 
[V2]
 Why lies He in such mean estate
 Where ox and ass are feeding?
 Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
 The silent Word is pleading.
 
[V3]
 So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
 Come, peasant, king, to own Him,
 The King of kings salvation brings,
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him.</lyrics>
