    <lyrics>[V1]
 Encamped along the hills of light,
 Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
 And press the battle ere the night
 Shall veil the glowing skies.
 Against the foe in vales below,
 Let all our strength be hurled;
 Faith is the victory, we know,
 That overcomes the world.
 
[C]
 Faith is the victory!
 Faith is the victory!
 Oh, glorious victory
 That overcomes the world.
 
[V2]
 His banner over us in love,
 Our sword the Word of God;
 We tread the road the saints above
 With shouts of triumph trod.
 By faith they, like whirlwind’s breath,
 Swept on o’er ev’ry field;
 The faith by which they conquered death
 Is still our shining shield.
 
[V3]
 To him who overcomes the foe
 White raiment shall be giv’n;
 Before the angels he shall know
 His name confessed in heav’n.
 Then onward from the hills of light,
 Our hearts with love aflame;
 We’ll vanquish all the hosts of night,
 In Jesus’ conq’ring name.</lyrics>
