    <lyrics>[V1]
 “Go, preach My gospel,” saith the Lord;
 “Bid the whole world My grace receive;
 He shall be saved who trusts My word,
 And they condemned who disbelieve.
 
[V2]
 “I’ll make your great commission known,
 And ye shall prove My gospel true
 By all the works that I have done,
 By all the wonders ye shall do.
 
[V3]
 “Teach all the nations My commands;
 I’m with you till the world shall end;
 All power is vested in My hands;
 I can destroy, and I defend.”
 
[V4]
 He spake, and light shone round His head;
 On a bright cloud to heaven He rode;
 They to the farthest nations spread
 The grace of their ascended Lord.</lyrics>
