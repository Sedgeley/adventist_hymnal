    <lyrics>[V1]
 O sacred Head, now wounded,
 with grief and shame weighed down,
 now scornfully surounded
 with thorns, thine only crown:
 how pale thou art with anguish,
 with sore abuse and scorn!
 How does that visage languish
 which once was bright as morn!
 
[V2]
 What thou, my Lord, has suffered
 was all for sinners’ gain;
 mine, mine was the transgression,
 but thine the deadly pain.
 Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
 ‘Tis I deserve thy place;
 look on me with thy favor,
 vouchsafe to me thy grace.
 
[V3]
 What language shall I borrow
 to thank thee, dearest friend,
 for this thy dying sorrow,
 thy pity without end?
 O make me thine forever;
 and should I fainting be,
 Lord, let me never, never
 outlive my love for thee.</lyrics>
