    <lyrics>[V1]
 O sing a song of Bethlehem,
 Of shepherds watching there,
 And of the news that came to them
 From angels in the air:
 The light that shone on Bethlehem
 Fills all the world today;
 Of Jesusâ€™birth and peace on earth
 The angels sing alway.
 
[V2]
 O sing a song of Nazareth,
 Of sunny days of joy,
 O sing of fragrant flowers breath,
 And of the sinless Boy:
 For now the flowers of Nazareth
 In every heart may grow;
 Now spreads the fame of His dear name
 On all the winds that blow.
 
[V3]
 O sing a song of Calvary,
 Its glory and dismay;
 Of Him who hung upon the tree,
 And took our sins away:
 For He who died on Calvary
 Is risen from the grave;
 And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,
 Is mighty now to save.</lyrics>
