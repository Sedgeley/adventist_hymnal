    <lyrics>[V1]
 O God, our help in ages past,
 our hope for years to come,
 our shelter from the stormy blast,
 and our eternal home!
 
[V2]
 Under the shadow of thy throne,
 still may we dwell secure;
 sufficient is thine arm alone,
 and our defense is sure.
 
[V3]
 Before the hills in order stood,
 or earth received her frame,
 from everlasting, thou art God,
 to endless years the same.
 
[V4]
 A thousand ages, in thy sight,
 are like an evening gone;
 short as the watch that ends the night,
 before the rising sun.
 
[V5]
 O God, our help in ages past,
 our hope for years to come;
 be thou our guide while life shall last,
 and our eternal home!</lyrics>
