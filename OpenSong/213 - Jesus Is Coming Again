    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring:
 Jesus is coming again!
 Cheer up, ye pilgrims, be joyful and sing:
 Jesus is coming again!
 
[C]
 Coming again, coming again,
 Jesus is coming again!
 
[V2]
 Echo it, hilltops; proclaim it, ye plains:
 Jesus is coming again!
 Coming in glory, the Lamb that was slain;
 Jesus is coming again!
 
[V3]
 Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wondering throng:
 Jesus is coming again!
 Tempests and whirlwinds, the anthem prolong;
 Jesus is coming again!
 
[V4]
 Nations are angryâ€“by this we do know
 Jesus is coming again!
 Knowledge increases; men run to and fro;
 Jesus is coming again!</lyrics>
