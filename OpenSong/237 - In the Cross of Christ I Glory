    <lyrics>[V1]
 In the cross of Christ I glory,
 towering o’er the wrecks of time;
 all the light of sacred story
 gathers round its head sublime.
 
[V2]
 When the woes of life o’ertake me,
 hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
 never shall the cross forsake me.
 Lo! it glows with peace and joy.
 
[V3]
 When the sun of bliss is beaming
 light and love upon my way,
 from the cross the radiance streaming
 adds more luster to the day.
 
[V4]
 Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
 by the cross are sanctified;
 peace is there that knows no measure,
 joys that through all time abide.</lyrics>
