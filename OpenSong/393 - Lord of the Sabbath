    <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord of the Sabbath and its light,
 I hail Thy hallowed day of rest;
 It is my weary soul’s delight,
 The solace of my careworn breast,
 The solace of my careworn breast.
 
[V2]
 O sacred day of peace and joy,
 Thy hours are ever dear to me;
 Ne’er may a sinful thought destroy
 The holy calm I find in thee,
 The holy calm I find in thee.
 
[V3]
 How sweetly now they glide along!
 How hallowed is the calm they yield!
 Transporting is their rapturous song,
 And heavenly visions seem revealed,
 And heavenly visions seem revealed.
 
[V4]
 O Jesus, let me ever hail
 Thy presence with the day of rest;
 Then will Thy servant never fail
 To deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest,
 To deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest.</lyrics>
