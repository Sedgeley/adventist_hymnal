    <lyrics>[V1]
 From every stormy wind that blows,
 From every swelling tide of woes,
 There is a calm, a sure retreat:
 ‘Tis found beneath the mercy seat.
 
[V2]
 There is a place where Jesus sheds
 The oil of gladness on our heads,
 A place than all besides more sweet;
 It is the blood-bought mercy seat.
 
[V3]
 There is a scene where spirits blend,
 Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
 Though sundered far, by faith they meet
 Around one common mercy seat.
 
[V4]
 There, there, on angel’s wings we soar,
 And earthly cares molest no more,
 And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
 And glory crowns the mercy seat.
 
[V5]
 Ah! whither should we flee for aid,
 When tempted, desolate dismayed?
 Or how the hosts of sin defeat,
 Had suffering saints no mercy seat?</lyrics>
