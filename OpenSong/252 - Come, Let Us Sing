    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, let us sing the song of songs
 The angels first began the strain
 The homage which to Christ belongs:
 “Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”
 
[V2]
 Slain to redeem us by His blood,
 To cleanse from every sinful stain,
 And make us kings and priests to God:
 “Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”
 
[V3]
 To Him who suffered on the tree,
 Our souls, at His soul’s price, to gain,
 Blessing, and praise, and glory be:
 “Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”
 
[V4]
 To Him, enthroned by filial right
 All power in heaven and earth proclaim,
 Honor, and majesty, and might:
 “Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”
 
[V5]
 Long as we live, and when we die,
 And while in heaven with Him we reign,
 This song our song of songs shall be:
 “Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”</lyrics>
