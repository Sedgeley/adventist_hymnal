    <lyrics>[V1]
 Is this a day of new beginnings,
 Time to remember and move on,
 Time too believe what love is bringing,
 Laying to rest the pain that’s gone?
 
[V2]
 How can the seasons of a planet
 Mindlessly spinning round its sun
 With just a human name and number
 Say that some new thing has begun?
 
[V3]
 Yet through the life and death of Jesus
 Love’s mighty Spirit, now as then,
 Can make for us a world of difference
 As faith and hope are born again.
 
[V4]
 Then let us, with the Spirit’s daring,
 Step from the past and leave behind
 Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,
 Seeking new paths, and sure to find.
 
[V5]
 Christ is alive, and goes before us
 To show and share what love can do.
 This is a day of new beginnings;
 Our God is making all things new.</lyrics>
