    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
 Does his successive journeys run;
 His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
 Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
 
[V2]
 People and realms of ev’ry tongue
 Dwell on His love with sweetest song,
 And infant voices shall proclaim
 Their early blessings on His name.
 
[V3]
 Blessings abound wherever He reigns;
 The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;
 The weary find eternal rest,
 And all who suffer want are blessed.
 
[V4]
 Let every creature rise and bring
 Honors peculiar to our King;
 Angels descend with songs again,
 And earth repeat the loud amen!</lyrics>
