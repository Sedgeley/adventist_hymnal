    <lyrics>[V1]
 Let your heart be broken for a world in need:
 Feed the mouths that hunger, soothe the wounds that bleed,
 Give the cup of water and the loaf of bread
 Be the hands of Jesus, serving in His stead.
 
[V2]
 Here on earth applying principles of love,
 Visible expression – God still rules above
 Living illustration of the Living Word
 To the minds of all who’ve Never seen or heard.
 
[V3]
 Blest to be a blessing privileged to care,
 Challenged by the need apparent everywhere.
 Where mankind is wanting, fill the vacant place.
 Be the means through which the Lord reveals His grace.
 
[V4]
 Add to your believing deeds that prove it true,
 Knowing Christ as Savior, make Him Master, too.
 Follow in His footsteps, go where He has trod;
 In the world’s great trouble risk yourself for God.
 
[V5]
 Let your heart be tender and your vision clear;
 See mankind as God sees, serve Him far and near.
 Let your heart be broken by a brother’s pain;
 Share your rich resources, give and give again.</lyrics>
