    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, sing a song of harvest, Of thanks for daily food!
 To offer God the first-fruits is old as gratitude.
 
[V2]
 Long, long ago, the reapers, before they kept the feast,
 Put first-fruits in a basket, and took it to the priest.
 
[V3]
 Shall we, sometimes forgetful oh where creation starts,
 With science in our pockets lose wonder from our hearts?
 
[V4]
 May God, the great Creator, to whom all life belongs,
 Accept these gifts we offer, our service and our songs.
 
[V5]
 And lest the world go hungry while we ourselves are fed,
 Make each of us more ready to share our daily bread.</lyrics>
