    <lyrics>[V1]
 The judgment has set, the books have been opened;
 How shall we stand in that great day,
 When every thought, and word, and action,
 God, the righteous Judge, shall weigh?
 
[C]
 How shall we stand in that great day?
 How shall we stand in that great day?
 Shall we be found before Him wanting?
 Or with our sins all washed away?
 
[V2]
 The work is begun with those who are sleeping,
 Soon will the living here be tried,
 Out of the books of Godâ€™s remembrance,
 His decision to abide.
 
[V3]
 O, how shall we stand that moment of searching,
 When all our sins those books reveal?
 When from that court, each case decided,
 Shall be granted no appeal?</lyrics>
