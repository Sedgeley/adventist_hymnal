    <lyrics>[V1]
 Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,
 Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;
 Our all to Thee we give, for Thee alone we live,
 And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.
 
[V2]
 Along the city’s waste, working with Thee,
 Our eager footsteps haste, like Thee to be;
 The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,
 And labor souls to win, working with Thee.
 
[V3]
 Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,
 As hard as Thine our lot can never be;
 Our joy and comfort this, “Thy grace sufficent is;”
 This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.
 
[V4]
 So let us labor on, working with Thee,
 Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;
 Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,
 And join us evermore, working with Thee.</lyrics>
