    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
 He had to walk it by Himself.
 O nobody else could walk it for Him.
 He had to walk it by Himself.
 
[V2]
 I must go and stand my trial.
 I have to stand it by myself.
 O nobody else could stand it for me.
 I have to stand it by myself.
 
[V3]
 Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
 He had to walk it by Himself.
 O nobody else could walk it for Him.
 He had to walk it by Himself.</lyrics>
