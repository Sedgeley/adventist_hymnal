    <lyrics>[V1]
 With songs and honors sounding loud,
 Address the Lord on high;
 Over the heavens He spreads His cloud,
 And waters veil the sky.
 
[V2]
 He sends His showers of blessing down
 To cheer the plains below;
 He makes the grass the mountains crown,
 And corning valleys grow.
 
[V3]
 His steady counsels change the face
 Of the declining year;
 He bids the sun cut short his race,
 And wintry days appear.
 
[V4]
 He sends His word, and melts the snow;
 The fields no longer mourn;
 He calls the warmer gales to blow,
 And bids the spring return.
 
[V5]
 The changing wind, the flying cloud,
 Obey His mighty word:
 With songs and honors sounding loud
 Praise ye the sovereign Lord!</lyrics>
