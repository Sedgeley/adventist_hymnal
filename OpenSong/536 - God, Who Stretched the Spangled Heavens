    <lyrics>[V1]
 God, who stretched the spangled heavens
 Infinite in time and place,
 Flung the suns in burning radiance
 Through the silent fields of space;
 We, Your children in Your likeness,
 Share inventive powers with You;
 Great Creator, still creating,
 Show us what we yet may do.
 
[V2]
 We have ventured worlds undreamed of
 Since the childhood of our race;
 Knowing the ecstasy of winging
 Through untraveled realms of space,
 Probed the secrets of the atom,
 Yielding unimagined power,
 Facing us with lifeâ€™s destruction
 Or our most triumphant hour.
 
[V3]
 As each far horizon beckons,
 May it challenge us anew:
 Children of creative purpose,
 Serving others, honoring You.
 May our dreams prove rich with promise;
 Each endeavor well begun;
 Great Creator, give us guidance
 Till our goals and Yours are one.</lyrics>
