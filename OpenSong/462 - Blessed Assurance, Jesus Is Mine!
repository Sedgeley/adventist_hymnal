    <lyrics>[V1]
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
 O what a foretaste of glory divine!
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
 born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.
 
[C]
 This is my story, this is my song,
 praising my Savior all the day long;
 this is my story, this is my song,
 praising my Savior all the day long.
 
[V2]
 Perfect submission, perfect delight,
 visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
 angels descending bring from above
 echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
 
[V3]
 Perfect submission, all is at rest;
 I in my Savior am happy and blest,
 watching and waiting, looking above,
 filled with his goodness, lost in his love.</lyrics>
