    <lyrics>[V1]
 On a hill far away
 stood an old rugged cross,
 the emblem of suffering and shame;
 and I love that old cross
 where the dearest and best
 for a world of lost sinners was slain.
 
[C]
 So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
 till my trophies at last I lay down;
 I will cling to the old rugged cross,
 and exchange it some day for a crown.
 
[V2]
 O that old rugged cross,
 so despised by the world,
 has a wondrous attraction for me;
 for the dear Lamb of God
 left his glory above
 to bear it to dark Calvary.
 
[V3]
 To that old rugged cross
 I will ever be true,
 its shame and reproach gladly bear;
 then he’ll call me some day
 to my home far away,
 where his glory forever I’ll share.</lyrics>
