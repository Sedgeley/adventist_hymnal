    <lyrics>[V1]
 Happy the home when God is there,
 and love fills every breast;
 when one their wish, and one their prayer,
 and one their heavenly rest.
 
[V2]
 Happy the home where Jesusâ€™ name
 is sweet to every ear;
 where children early speak his fame,
 and parents hold him dear.
 
[V3]
 Happy the home where prayer is heard,
 and praise is wont to rise;
 where parents love the sacred Word
 and all its wisdom prize.
 
[V4]
 Lord, let us in our homes agree
 this blessed peace to gain;
 unite our hearts in love to thee,
 and love to all will reign.</lyrics>
