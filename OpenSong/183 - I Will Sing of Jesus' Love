    <lyrics>[V1]
 I Will sing of Jesus love,
 Sing of Him,who first loved me;
 for He left bright worlds above,
 And died on Calvary.
 
[C]
 I will sing of Jesus love
 Endless praise my heart shall give;
 He has died that I might live
 I will sing His love to me.
 
[V2]
 O the depths of love divine!
 Earth or heaven can never know
 How that sin as dark as mine
 can be made as white as snow.
 
[V3]
 Nothing good for Him Iâ€™ve done;
 How could He such love bestow?
 Lord, I own my heart is won,
 help me now my love to show.</lyrics>
