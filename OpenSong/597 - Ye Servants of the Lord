    <lyrics>[V1]
 Ye servants of the Lord,
 Each in his office wait,
 Observant of His heavenly Word,
 And watchful at His gate.
 
[V2]
 Let all your lamps be bright,
 And trim the golden flame,
 Gird up your loins as in His sight,
 His coming thus proclaim.
 
[V3]
 Watch, ’tis your Lord’s command,
 And while we speak He’s near;
 Mark the first signal of His hand,
 And ready all appear.
 
[V4]
 O happy servant, he,
 In such a posture found!
 He shall His Lord with rapture see,
 And be with honor crowned.</lyrics>
