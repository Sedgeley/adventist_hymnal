    <lyrics>[V1]
 God Himself is with us;
 Let us all adore Him,
 And with awe appear before Him.
 God is here within us;
 Soul, in silence fear Him,
 Humbly, fervently draw near Him.
 Now His own who have known God,
 In worship lowly,
 Yield their spirits wholly.
 
[V2]
 Come, abide within me;
 Let my soul, like Mary,
 Be Thine earthly sanctuary.
 Come, indwelling Spirit,
 With transfigured splendor;
 Love and honor will I render.
 Where I go here below,
 Let me bow before Thee,
 Know Thee and adore Thee.
 
[V3]
 Gladly we surrender
 Earth’s deceitful treasures,
 Pride of life and sinful pleasures:
 Gladly, Lord, we offer
 Thine to be forever,
 Soul and life and each endeavor.
 Thou alone shall be known
 Lord of all our being,
 Life’s true way decreeing.</lyrics>
