    <lyrics>[V1]
 Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
 Too deeply for mirth and song;
 As the burdens press, and the cares distress,
 And the way grows weary and long?
 
[C]
 O yes, He cares- I know He cares!
 His heart is touched with my grief;
 When the days are weary,
 The long nights dreary,
 I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)
 
[V2]
 Does Jesus care when my way is dark
 With a nameless dread and fear?
 As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
 Does He care enough to be near?
 
[V3]
 Does Jesus care when I’ve said goodbye
 To the dearest on earth to me,
 And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks ­
 Is it aught to Him? Does He see?</lyrics>
