    <lyrics>[V1]
 Gracious Father, guard Thy children
 From the foe’s destructive power;
 Save, O save them, Lord, from falling
 In this dark and trying hour.
 Thou wilt surely prove Thy people,
 All our graces must be tried;
 But Thy word illumes our pathway,
 And in God we still confide.
 
[V2]
 We are in the time of waiting;
 Soon we shall behold our Lord,
 Wafted far away from sorrow,
 To receive our rich reward.
 Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,
 Pure, unspotted from the world;
 Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us
 Till Thy banner is unfurled.
 
[V3]
 With what joyful exultation
 Shall the saints Thy banner see,
 When the Lord for whom we’ve waited
 Shall proclaim the jubilee!
 Freedom from this world’s pollutions;
 Freedom from all sin and pain;
 Freedom from the wiles of Satan,
 And from death’s destructive reign.</lyrics>
