    <lyrics>[V1]
 It may not be on the mountain height
 Or over the stormy sea,
 It may not be at the battle’s front
 My Lord will have need of me.
 But if, by a still, small voice he calls
 To paths that I do not know,
 I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine;
 I’ll go where you want me to go.
 
[C]
 I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
 Over mountain or plain or sea;
 I’ll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;
 I’ll be what you want me to be.
 
[V2]
 Perhaps today there are loving words
 Which Jesus would have me speak
 There may be now in the paths of sin
 Some wand’rer whom I should seek.
 O Savior, if thou wilt be my guide,
 Tho dark and rugged the way,
 My voice shall echo the message sweet;
 I’ll say what you want me to say.
 
[V3]
 There’s surely somewhere a lowly place
 In earth’s harvest fields so wide
 Where I may labor through life’s short day
 For Jesus, the Crucified.
 So trusting my all to thy tender care,
 And knowing thou lovest me,
 I’ll do thy will with a heart sincere:
 I’ll be what you want me to be.</lyrics>
