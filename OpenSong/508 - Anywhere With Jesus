    <lyrics>[V1]
 Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
 Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
 Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
 Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.
 
[C]
 Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
 Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
 
[V2]
 Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
 Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
 Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways,
 Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.
 
[V3]
 Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
 When the darkening shadows round about me creep,
 Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
 Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.</lyrics>
