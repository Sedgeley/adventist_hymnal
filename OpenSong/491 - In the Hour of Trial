    <lyrics>[V1]
 In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
 Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
 When Thou seeâ€™st me waver, with a look recall,
 Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.
 
[V2]
 With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;
 Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
 Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,
 Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.
 
[V3]
 Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe,
 Or should pain attend me on my path below,
 Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;
 Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.</lyrics>
