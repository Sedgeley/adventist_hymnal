    <lyrics>[V1]
 A diligent and grateful heart
 Prompts me to sing Thy praise.
 Thy love and mercies from the start
 Have blessed me all my days.
 
[V2]
 I thank Thee for the means to serve
 With talents and with tithes,
 For sharing brings the utmost joy
 When lifting other lives.
 
[V3]
 My thanks I give you for stewardship
 To minister through deeds,
 To serve and share with patient care
 Thy people in their needs.
 
[V4]
 O Lord, I dedicate my all
 In this response to Thee.
 Help me to magnify this call
 In deep humility.</lyrics>
