    <lyrics>[V1]
 God is my strong salvation,
 What foe have I to fear?
 In darkness and temptation,
 My Light, my Help, is near:
 Though hosts encamp around me,
 Firm in the fight I stand;
 What terror can confound me,
 With God at my right hand?
 
[V2]
 Place on the reliance;
 My soul with courage wait;
 His truth be thine affiance,
 When faint and desolate.
 His might thy heart shall strengthen,
 His love thy joy increase;
 Mercy thy days shall lengthen;
 The Lord will give thee peace.</lyrics>
