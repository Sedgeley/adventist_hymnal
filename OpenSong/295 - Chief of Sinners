    <lyrics>[V1]
 Chief of sinners though I be,
 Jesus shed His blood for me;
 Died that I might live on high,
 Died that I might never die;
 As the brance is to the vine,
 I am His, and He is mine.
 
[V2]
 O the height of Jesusâ€™ love!
 Higher than the heaven above,
 Deeper than the deepest sea,
 Lasting as eternity;
 Love that found me-wondrous thought!
 Found me when I sought Him not!
 
[V3]
 Chief of sinners though I be,
 Christ is all in all to me;
 All my wants to Him are known,
 All my sorrows are His own;
 Safe with Him from earthly strife,
 He sustains the hidden life.</lyrics>
