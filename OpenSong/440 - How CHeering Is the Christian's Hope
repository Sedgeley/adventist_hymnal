    <lyrics>[V1]
 How cheering is the Christianâ€™s hope,
 While toiling here below!
 It bouys us up while this passing through
 This wilderness of woe,
 
[V2]
 It bouys us up while this passing through
 This wilderness of woe,
 It bouys us up while passing through
 This wilderness of woe.
 
[V3]
 It points us to a land of rest,
 Where saints with Christ will reign;
 Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
 And never part again.
 
[V4]
 Fly, lingering moments, fly, O, fly,
 Dear Savior, quickly come!
 We long to see Thee as Thou art,
 And reach that blissful home.</lyrics>
