    <lyrics>[V1]
 Thereâ€™s a land that is fairer than day,
 And by faith we can see it afar;
 For the Father waits over the way
 To prepare us a dwelling place there.
 
[C]
 In the sweet in the sweet
 By and by by and by,
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
 In the sweet in the sweet
 By and by by and by
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
 
[V2]
 We shall sing on that beautiful shore
 The melodious songs of the blest,
 And our spirits shall sorrow no more
 Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.
 
[V3]
 To our bountiful father above
 We will offer our tribute of praise;
 For the glorious gift of His love
 And the blessings that hallow our days.</lyrics>
