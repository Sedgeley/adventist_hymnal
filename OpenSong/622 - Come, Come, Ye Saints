    <lyrics>[V1]
 Come, come, ye saints,
 no toil nor labor fear;
 But with joy wend your way.
 Though hard to you the journey may appear,
 Grace shall be as your day.
 We will have a living lord to guide,
 And we can trust Him to provide;
 Do this, and joy your hearts will swell:
 All is well! All is well!
 
[V2]
 We’ll find the rest which God for us prepared,
 When at last He will call;
 Where none will come to hurt or make afraid,
 He will reign over all.
 We will make the air with music ring,
 Shout praise to God our Lord and King:
 O how we’ll make the chorus swell:
 All is well! All is well!</lyrics>
