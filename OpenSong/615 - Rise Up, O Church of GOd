    <lyrics>[V1]
 Rise up, O men of God!
 His kingdom tarries long.
 Bring in the day of brotherhood
 and end the night of wrong.
 
[V2]
 Let women all rise up!
 Have done with lesser things.
 Give heart and mind and soul and strength
 to serve the King of kings.
 
[V3]
 Rise up, courageous youth!
 The church for you doth wait,
 her strength unequal to her task;
 rise up, and make her great!
 
[V4]
 Lift high the cross of Christ!
 Tread where his feet have trod.
 Disciples of the Son of Man,
 rise up, O church of God!</lyrics>
