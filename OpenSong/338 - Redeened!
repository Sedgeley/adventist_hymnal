    <lyrics>[V1]
 Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
 Redeemed throâ€™ His infinite mercy,
 His child, and forever, I am.
 
[C]
 Redeemed, redeemed,
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
 Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
 His child and forever I am.
 
[V2]
 I think of my blessed Redeemer,
 I think of Him all the day long;
 I sing, for I cannot be silent;
 His love is the theme of my song.
 
[V3]
 I know I shall see in His beauty
 The King in whose law I delight,
 Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
 And giveth me songs in the night.</lyrics>
