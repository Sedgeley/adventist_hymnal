    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts!
 Thou fount of life! Thou light of men!
 From the best bliss that earth imparts,
 We turn unfilled to Thee again.
 
[V2]
 Thy truth unchanged has ever stood;
 Thou savest those that on Thee call;
 To them that seek Thee Thou art good,
 To them that find Thee, all in all.
 
[V3]
 We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,
 And long to feast upon Thee still;
 We drink of Thee, the Fountainhead,
 And thirst our souls from Thee to fill!
 
[V4]
 Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,
 Where-e’r our changeful lot is cast;
 Glad, when Thy gracious smile we see,
 Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.
 
[V5]
 O Jesus, ever with us stay;
 Make all our moments calm and bright;
 Chase the dark night of sin away,
 Shed o’r the world Thy holy light!</lyrics>
