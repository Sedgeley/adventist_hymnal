    <lyrics>[V1]
 The homeland! O the homeland!
 The land of the free born!
 There’s no night in the homeland,
 But aye the fadeless morn;
 I’m sighing for homeland,
 My heart is aching here;
 There is no pain in the homeland
 To which I’m drawing near;
 There is no pain in the homeland
 To which I’m drawing near.
 
[V2]
 My Lord is in the homeland,
 With angels bright and fair;
 There’s no sin in the homeland,
 And no temptation there;
 The music of the homeland
 Is ringing in my ears;
 And when I think of the homeland
 My eyes are filled with tears;
 And when I think of the homeland
 My ears are filled with tears.
 
[V3]
 The dwellers in the homeland
 Are beckoning me to come,
 Where neither death nor sorrow
 Invades their holy name;
 O dear, dear native country!
 O rest and peace above!
 Christ bring us all to the homeland
 Of Thy redeeming love;
 Christ bring us all to the homeland
 Of Thy redeeming love</lyrics>
