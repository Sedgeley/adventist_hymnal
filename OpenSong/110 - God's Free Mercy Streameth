    <lyrics>[V1]
 God’s free mercy streameth
 over all the world,
 And His banner gleameth,
 By His church unfuried;
 Broad and deep and glorious,
 As the heaven above,
 Shines in might victorious
 His eternal love.
 
[V2]
 Summer suns are glowing
 over land and sea;
 Happy light is flowing,
 Bountiful and free;
 Everything rejoices
 in the mellow rays;
 Earth’s ten thousand voices
 swell the psalm of praise.
 
[V3]
 Lord, upon our blindness
 thy pure radiance pour;
 For Thy loving kindness
 we would love Thee more;
 And when clouds are drifting
 dark across the sky,
 Then, the veil uplifting,
 father, be Thou nigh.
 
[V4]
 We will never doubt Thee,
 tho’ veil Thy light;
 Life is dark without Thee,
 death with Thee is bright.
 Light of light, shine o’er
 us on our pilgrim way,
 Go Thou still before us
 to the endless day.</lyrics>
