    <lyrics>[V1]
 O Jesus, thou art standing,
 outside the fast closed door,
 in lowly patience waiting
 to pass the threshold o’er:
 O shame, professing Christians,
 his Name and sign who bear,
 O shame, thrice shame upon us,
 to keep him standing there!
 
[V2]
 O Jesus, thou art knocking;
 and lo, that hand is scarred,
 and thorns thy brow encircle,
 and tears thy face have marred:
 O love that passeth knowledge,
 so patiently to wait!
 O sin that hath no equal,
 so fast to bar the gate!
 
[V3]
 O Jesus, thou art pleading
 in accents meek and low,
 “I died for you, my children,
 and will you treat me so?”
 O Lord, with shame and sorrow
 we open now the door;
 dear Savior, enter, enter,
 and leave us never more.</lyrics>
