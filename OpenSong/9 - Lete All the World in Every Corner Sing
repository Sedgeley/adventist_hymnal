    <lyrics>[V1]
 Let all the world in every corner sing,
 My God and King!
 The heavens are not too high,
 His praise may thither fly;
 The earth is not too low,
 His praises there may grow.
 Let all the world in every corner sing,
 My God and King!
 
[V2]
 Let all the world in every corner sing,
 My God and King!
 The church with psalms must shout,
 No door can keep them out;
 But, above all, the heart
 must bear the longest part.
 Let all the world in every corner sing,
 My God and King!</lyrics>
