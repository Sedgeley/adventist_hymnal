    <lyrics>[V1]
 We gather together to ask
 the Lordâ€™s blessing;
 He chastens and hastens
 His will to make known.
 The wicked oppressing
 now cease from distressing.
 Sing praises to His Name;
 He forgets not His own.
 
[V2]
 Beside us to guide us,
 our God with us joining,
 Ordaining, maintaining
 His kingdom divine;
 So from the beginning
 the fight we were winning;
 Thou, Lord, were at our side,
 all glory be Thine!
 
[V3]
 We all do extol Thee,
 Thou leader triumphant,
 And pray that Thou still
 our defender wilt be.
 Let Thy congregation
 escape tribulation;
 Thy name be ever praised!
 O Lord, make us free!</lyrics>
