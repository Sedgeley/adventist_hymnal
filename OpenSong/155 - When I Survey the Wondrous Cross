    <lyrics>[V1]
 When I survey the wondrous cross
 On which the Prince of glory died,
 My richest gain I count but loss,
 And pour contempt on all my pride.
 
[V2]
 See, from His head, His feet,
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
 Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet?
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
 
[V3]
 Since I, who was undone and lost,
 Have pardon through His name and word;
 Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
 Save in the cross of Christ my Lord.
 
[V4]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
 That were a tribute far too small;
 Love so amazing, so divine,
 Demands my life, my soul, my all.</lyrics>
