    <lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, Friend of little children,
 Be a friend to me;
 Take my hand and ever keep me
 Close to Thee.
 
[V2]
 Teach me how to grow in goodness,
 Daily as I grow;
 Thou hast been a child, and surely
 Thou dost know.
 
[V3]
 Step by step, O, lead me onward,
 Upward into youth;
 Wiser, stronger, still becoming
 In Thy truth.
 
[V4]
 Never leave me, nor forsake me;
 Ever be my friend;
 For I need Thee from lifeâ€™s dawning
 To its end.</lyrics>
